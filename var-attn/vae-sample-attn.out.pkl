you know , one of the great reasons about traveling and one of the jo@@ y@@ ful of ethni@@ c research is to live with the people who can still remember the old days , and the past that they still feel in the wind , they touch them on the rain , they touch them on the rain , taste them in the bit@@ ter leaves of the plants . </s>
just knowing that ja@@ gu@@ ar sha@@ fts travel still travel beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the meaning of the my@@ ths of in@@ u@@ it is still important , or that in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , the budd@@ hi@@ sts still follow the breath of d@@ har@@ ma , that means that the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropolog@@ y means anthropolog@@ y , that &apos;s the idea that the world we live in , not exists in a absolute sense , but only as a model of reality , as a result of reality , as a result of a group of certain possibilities of adap@@ tation , chose many generations . </s>
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tations . </s>
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world . </s>
we &apos;re through initi@@ ation ritu@@ als . </s>
we need to diver@@ t with the in@@ consi@@ stent separ@@ ation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art . </s>
but interestingly , the unique pit@@ ch of love , the rhyth@@ m of the dance in every culture in every culture . </s>
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the pen@@ c@@ ils in the forests of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ ths in haiti , or the war@@ ri@@ or in the ka@@ is@@ u@@ tt desert of northern kenya , the cur@@ sor of northern kenya , or a car@@ rot in the middle of the sahara . this inci@@ dent , inci@@ dent@@ ally , the colleague i went into the desert a month , or even a y@@ ak@@ -@@ she@@ pher@@ d on the top of q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , everest , the go@@ d@@ mother of the world . </s>
all these people are teaching us that there are other forms of life , other ways of thinking , different ways of ori@@ entation in the world . </s>
and that &apos;s an idea that , when you think about it , can ful@@ fill a single one of hope . </s>
together , the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world create a network of spiritual and cultural life that en@@ ables earth to change , and for the sa@@ ke of earth as important as earth is as important as the biological life system that you know as a bio@@ sphere . </s>
you can imagine this cultural life web as an eth@@ no@@ sphere , and eth@@ no@@ sphere can be the total sum of all thought and dreams , my@@ ths , my@@ ths and intui@@ tions , which have been defined by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness . </s>
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great legacy of humanity . </s>
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re able to do as a remark@@ ably wis@@ er species . </s>
and just as the bio@@ sphere was reje@@ cted , it happened to the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- only with even larger speed . </s>
for example , no biolog@@ ist would claim that 50 percent or more of all species are just before extin@@ ction , because it just isn &apos;t right . and yet , this -- the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ario in the field of bio@@ diversity -- is very much very much about what &apos;s known as an most optimistic case in the field of cultural diversity . </s>
and the critical indi@@ c@@ ator of that is the extin@@ ction of languages . </s>
when each of you was born in this room , the earth has been spoken to 6@@ ,000 languages . </s>
now , a language is not just the accu@@ racy of the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a series of gra@@ m@@ mar creatures . </s>
a language is expression of the human mind . </s>
it &apos;s a means where the soul of a certain culture will find access to the material world . </s>
every language is like an ancient forest of the mind , an in@@ fle@@ ction point , an idea , an ecosystem of spiritual opportunity . </s>
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , half of them don &apos;t whis@@ per in the ears of children . </s>
they &apos;re not going to teach small kids , which means , if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead . </s>
what might be more lon@@ ely than being surrounded by the silence of being one of the last people who speak your language , not having an opportunity to pass the wisdom of the ance@@ stra@@ l wisdom , or expect the hope to expect children ? </s>
and yet this horrible fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful fa@@ te is actually someone anywhere on earth , about two weeks , because every two weeks , an el@@ derly dies dies and takes the final sil@@ ver of an old language with the gra@@ ve . </s>
and i know some of you are saying , &quot; isn &apos;t it better than that ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all would speak a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be this language yor@@ u@@ ba . let &apos;s be can@@ adi@@ an . </s>
let them be alterna@@ te . &quot; </s>
and then you &apos;d suddenly see what it would be like if you could not talk to your own language . </s>
so today i &apos;d like to take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a quick journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere to try and understand what &apos;s actually been lost . </s>
now there are some of us that , in a sense , for@@ gotten that i say that when i say &quot; different possibilities of being , &quot; really different possibilities for existence . </s>
for example , take this child of bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west of the amazon , the people of the an@@ a@@ da , believe that they came up with myth@@ ological flow from the east in the bel@@ ly in the bel@@ ly of sa@@ int sna@@ kes . </s>
this is a people which don &apos;t cogni@@ tively dist@@ ingu@@ ish between color and green green , because the sky is the hea@@ v@@ ens of the forest that people depend on . </s>
they have a strange language and a mar@@ vel@@ ous called lingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ og@@ am@@ ia : you have to mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks a different language . </s>
all of this is ro@@ ot@@ ed in the myth@@ ological past . the strange houses of these big houses , which are spoken by six or seven or seven languages , are told that you never hear somebody who lear@@ ns a language . </s>
they just stop listening , and then they start speaking . </s>
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the wa@@ oran@@ i in the nor@@ the@@ astern of ecu@@ ad@@ or , has an amazing people that was first cont@@ ac@@ ted in 195@@ 8 . </s>
in 195@@ 7 , five mission@@ aries tried to contact contact and made a severe mistake . </s>
they were waiting glass photographs from the air down , which we would be looking for as a friendly gest@@ ure , and they for@@ got that these people from the rain@@ forest in their lives had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional . </s>
they took these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the character , found nothing and conclu@@ ding that this was the business of the de@@ vil and killed the five mission@@ aries with the spe@@ ar . </s>
but the wa@@ oran@@ i killing not just out@@ standing out@@ standing with the spe@@ ars . </s>
they went through each other . </s>
5@@ 4 percent of deaths happened by dri@@ ll@@ ing . </s>
we followed gene@@ tici@@ sts eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people to do something about it , they said that one of the people was so old that he died on his age , and we still killed him with the spe@@ ar . </s>
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing . </s>
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell the ur@@ ine of a animal out of 40 steps and determine what animals would listen to . </s>
in the early &apos; 80s , i got a really amazing task , when my professor at harvard asked me whether i was interested in going to haiti and in@@ fil@@ tra@@ te the secret societies that were the foundation of du@@ v@@ ali@@ ans and clay ton ma@@ cou@@ tes , and the ven@@ ton that was used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , to make sure . </s>
in order to give you a sense of this sen@@ ti@@ ment , i had to know something about this remarkable belief in vo@@ dou@@ n and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a cul@@ t of black magic . </s>
on the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical world view . </s>
it &apos;s interesting . </s>
if i asked you to count the great world record , what would you say ? </s>
chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever . </s>
a continent is always left , because the guess was that , in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , there was no religious belief in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa . of course there was one and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the remains of these very profound religious thoughts that came back during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of sla@@ very . </s>
but what makes vo@@ o@@ do@@ o do so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead . </s>
the living be@@ ars made the spi@@ ri@@ ts . </s>
the spi@@ ri@@ ts can be released from the great water , answers to the rhyth@@ m of dance , to ex@@ ec@@ ute the soul of the living of the living , so the ac@@ oly@@ th will be for a very brief moment to god . </s>
the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say , &quot; her white goes to the church and talking about god . </s>
we dance in the temp@@ le , and we become a god . &quot; </s>
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to take away from the mind . how can you be hurt ? </s>
you see these amazing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ ths in a tran@@ scen@@ dent state , the glo@@ wing coal without burning , an amazing illu@@ stration of the ability of the body to influence the body that pre@@ v@@ ents it when it &apos;s placed into a state of extreme ar@@ en@@ as . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
now , from all the people that i &apos;ve met , the sierra ne@@ v@@ ada de santa mar@@ ta has been in northern col@@ om@@ bia , the most extraordinary . </s>
after the old ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ an civilization , which popul@@ ated the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al level of col@@ om@@ bia , and in the after@@ math of the re@@ vel@@ ation , this people moved back into an isol@@ ated volcan@@ ic massi@@ vely that goes up over the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in . </s>
in a bloo@@ d@@ shed continent , these people were the only people who were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the spa@@ in . </s>
until the day today , they &apos;re gover@@ ned by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , and the pri@@ ority to pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is very extraordinary . </s>
the young ak@@ oly@@ ths are separated at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a sha@@ w@@ ling world of the fro@@ w@@ ns , in stone cab@@ in for 18 years of the gl@@ aci@@ er for 18 years , two peri@@ ods of each nine years , inten@@ tion@@ ally chosen to mi@@ mic the nine months of the preg@@ nan@@ cy that they spent in the la@@ p of their local mother , they now spend me@@ tam@@ or@@ ph@@ or@@ ic in the great mother &apos;s la@@ p . </s>
and throughout this time , they &apos;re cul@@ tur@@ ally introduced into the values of their society : values that susta@@ in the claim that their pra@@ yers and only their pra@@ yers , the cos@@ mic -- or we could say that the ecolo@@ gical -- balance equ@@ als . </s>
at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , you &apos;ll be taken out one day , and for the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , you &apos;re seeing a sun@@ rise . and in this cryst@@ al moment of consciousness , when the sun starts to rays of the amazing beautiful landscape , suddenly everything that they have learned in the abstract of the amazing beautiful landscape , and the pri@@ est comes back and the pri@@ est goes back and says , &quot; look , it &apos;s really how i &apos;ve told you . </s>
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot; </s>
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers responsible to be responsible for the destruction of the world . </s>
now this level of intuition becomes very important . </s>
whenever we think about in@@ fan@@ ts and landscape , we either con@@ co@@ ct r@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of the no@@ ble wil@@ der , which in his simpli@@ stic thought is a ra@@ cist idea or th@@ ore@@ au and saying , these people are more connected to nature than we are . </s>
now , in@@ fan@@ ts are not sen@@ ti@@ mental , they &apos;re still ki@@ cked off by the no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a . </s>
there is not a lot of place in malaria in the malaria or the cold win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , or the cold win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but still , through time and ritual , shaped a mysteri@@ ous ni@@ m@@ bus of the earth , not based on the idea of being aware of it , but on a much more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist , because it &apos;s embedded in the human mind . </s>
now , what does that mean ? </s>
it means that a little child from the an@@ ec@@ dot@@ es that grows in belie@@ ving that the mountain is an a@@ pu@@ -@@ mind that the mountain or your dest@@ ination will become a whole other person , and another relationship with this resource or this place , as a little child from mon@@ tana , who grows in belie@@ ving that a mountain is a bunch of rocks that can be de@@ voted . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
whether it &apos;s a mind of a mind or a bunch of er@@ rors , it &apos;s ir@@ relevant . </s>
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the nature of nature . </s>
i grew up in the forests of british col@@ om@@ bia , and i believed that these forests were there to be eradi@@ cated . </s>
this made me to another person as my friends under the k@@ wa@@ ki@@ u@@ t@@ l , who believe that these forests are the forests of hu@@ ku@@ k and the bo@@ ar@@ ding cele@@ bri@@ ty and the can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ic spi@@ ri@@ ts that live in the nor@@ the@@ astern of the world , spi@@ ri@@ ts they would engage in their ha@@ mat@@ sac@@ ian initi@@ ation . </s>
now , when you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different reali@@ ties , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here . </s>
it &apos;s a photograph i just took last april in the nor@@ th@@ west of the amazon . </s>
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard of , the stron@@ gest psycho@@ active pra@@ yer from the re@@ per@@ toi@@ re of sha@@ man . </s>
what makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca so fascinating is not just the pharma@@ colo@@ gical potential of this pre@@ par@@ ate , but its processing . it &apos;s actually made from two different sources . on the one hand , there are these woo@@ den li@@ ons , which are a series of woo@@ den li@@ ons , har@@ ap@@ lin , har@@ mo@@ lin , slightly hallu@@ cin@@ ate , slightly hallu@@ cin@@ ated . that clim@@ bing plant alone is something like a blue tr@@ unk of smoke on your consciousness , but it &apos;s mix@@ ed with the leaves of the coffee plant with the name of the coffee plants called the psych@@ ot@@ ria vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is . </s>
this plant contains some very strong tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins that are very similar to the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in 5 and metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ ine tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in . </s>
and if you &apos;ve seen y@@ an@@ o@@ ma , if you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this sub@@ stance , that sub@@ stance , that you create from different species of species as well as metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ in . </s>
so this po@@ w@@ der is sort of s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ing out of a g@@ ate@@ way , sp@@ inning from b@@ aro@@ que paintings and land@@ ing on a sea of electricity . </s>
it &apos;s not going to create a di@@ stor@@ tion of reality , but the resolution of reality . </s>
i even got to my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ ter , who was the man who introduced the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c equ@@ re@@ a with the discovery of the magic mush@@ rooms in mexico in mexico in the 30@@ 0s . i suggest@@ ed that you couldn &apos;t ar@@ range these tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines as hallu@@ cin@@ ations , because in the moment you feel the effects , you &apos;re not there anymore to experience a hallu@@ cin@@ ation . </s>
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is that they can &apos;t be bi@@ ased , because they can be taken through a human gut enzy@@ me with called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ xi@@ d@@ ase , con@@ gr@@ atu@@ lations . </s>
they can only be done in relation to some other chemicals that the ma@@ o den@@ ies the ma@@ o den@@ ial . </s>
now what &apos;s fascinating is that the be@@ ta@@ k@@ ol@@ ol@@ ines that are conta@@ ined in the li@@ ons are ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of exactly the same species that are necessary to power tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . so , ask yourself . </s>
how can these people in a fl@@ ora of 8@@ 0,000 species of ad@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ ve plants can &apos;t find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologically related plants that , if in this way , combine a kind of bio@@ chemical version so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts ? </s>
we use this great eu@@ p@@ hemis@@ m , trial and error , which turns out to be meaning@@ less . </s>
but let &apos;s ask the indi@@ ans they say , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot; </s>
so , what does that mean ? </s>
this tri@@ fan , the co@@ fan , has 17 var@@ ie@@ ties of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which they all recognize very much at the distance in the forest for our eyes as a way . </s>
and then you ask them how to do their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y , and they say , &quot; i thought you hide some of the plants . </s>
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot; </s>
well , it turns out you &apos;re taking each of the 17 vari@@ ants on full moon , and you &apos;re singing to you in a different scale . </s>
now , this doesn &apos;t give you a ph.@@ d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than tri@@ be . </s>
well , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who are sym@@ pathy to the difficult position have been seen , they look as or@@ g@@ in@@ tic and color@@ ful , but somehow restri@@ cted to the past , while the real world , that is our world , pro@@ gr@@ essing . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
so , the fact is that , in the 20th century , in 300 years , you &apos;re not going to remember its wars or technological innovation , but rather than an era where we were ad@@ mit@@ ted and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either accep@@ ted or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted or passi@@ vely , so the problem is not change . </s>
all the cultures have kept involved in the dance with new forms of life . </s>
and the problem is not the technology at all . </s>

not change and technology thre@@ aten the integri@@ ty of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule . </s>
and wherever you &apos;re looking in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not cor@@ rup@@ ted . these are dynamic peop@@ les , whose existence is dis@@ placed by visible forces through their capacity of adap@@ tation . whether it &apos;s about the ou@@ trage@@ ous de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the home country of sou@@ the@@ ast , from sar@@ a@@ wa@@ k , from sar@@ a@@ wa@@ k , from sar@@ a@@ wa@@ k , a people who lived in front of a generation in the forest , and now humili@@ ating on the river and prostit@@ ution on the river , from where you can see that even half the flow on the mu@@ d is pollu@@ ted in the southern china . or as in the case of y@@ an@@ o@@ mom@@ i , they &apos;re willing to fill their shi@@ eld ; or like the y@@ an@@ o@@ ma , where they &apos;re willing to fill their shi@@ eld during the gold space

let &apos;s get something else out now . </s>
this is actually live on the internet now . you can check it . </s>
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really conne@@ cts two different technologies to each other . </s>
one is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ gon , and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which is no@@ ah sna@@ kes , a college student at washington university , under the coun@@ sel@@ ing of steve sil@@ tz at the u@@ w . </s>
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ ski was done by microsoft research , a very good collaboration . </s>
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ gon . </s>
you can see this when we create these kinds of views where we can pen@@ et@@ rate through images and experience that experience of several times . </s>
but the spa@@ tial appe@@ ar@@ ance of the picture is actually meaning here . </s>
the computer visi@@ ons have held these images together with the real space of the real room , where these images that were made near the grass@@ roots of the grass@@ roots in the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies -- they &apos;re looking at elements of stabili@@ zed slides or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imaging processing , and these things were all put together in relation to each other . </s>
i don &apos;t know exactly if i &apos;ve still had other environments to show you . </s>
there are ones that are much more space . </s>
i &apos;d like to just show you one of the original data sets of no@@ ah , and this is from a early prototype of photo@@ syn@@ th that we first worked in the summer to show you what i think it really is the pun@@ ish@@ ment behind this technology , photo@@ syn@@ c technology , and it &apos;s not necessarily so obvious if you look at the environments that we have on the website . </s>
we had to worry about the lawyers and the worry . </s>
this is a re@@ construction of the ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al not@@ re lady , who exclu@@ ded only in the computer with images of fli@@ ck@@ r . just give them not@@ ation lady in fli@@ ck@@ r , and they will get images from men in t-@@ shir@@ ts and on the university site and so on . every one of those orange angel@@ s represents a picture that has been discovered to this model of audi@@ ences . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
so these are all fli@@ ck@@ r images , and they &apos;re all spa@@ tial in relation to each other in this way . </s>
and we can navi@@ gate in this very simple way . </s>
you know , i never believed that i was going to work on microsoft &apos;s work . </s>
i &apos;m very gr@@ ateful for the re@@ ception here . </s>
i guess you can see that this is a lot of different types of cameras : everything is from the hand@@ -@@ camera to professional sl@@ ams , a fairly large number of them that have been put together in this environment . </s>
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird ones . </s>
many of them are covered by faces and so on . </s>
so somewhere here are a series of photographs -- there they are . </s>
this is actually a poster by not@@ re dame , who was really recorded . </s>
we can change from the poster to a physical perspective in the environment . </s>
the point is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s now being collected from all the data -- from the whole collective memory of how , visu@@ ally , the earth -- and everything is connected to each other . </s>
all of these photographs are inter@@ connected , and it creates something larger than the sum of the parts of the parts . </s>
they get a model that emer@@ ges from all over the earth . </s>
think of it as the continu@@ ation of stephen law@@ ler &apos;s work on virtual earth . </s>
and that is something that is growing through the complexity that people use , and that uses the user for the user to use it . </s>
your own pictures are re@@ placed with meta@@ data that another person has given . </s>
if someone has done the mos@@ qui@@ to , and all this hol@@ y has lab@@ eled and communic@@ ated who they &apos;re all , my photo is made from the not@@ re ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral suddenly with all of this data , and i can use them as a starting point to dive into this space , into these meta@@ ver@@ bs that use photographs of other people and make a sort of trans@@ forming model of social experience with the use of others . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
and of course , by@@ product all of this is the immen@@ se rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , which have been not only deli@@ vered by over@@ fli@@ pping or satellite images and so on , but through collective memory . </s>
thank you . </s>
do i get it right ? your software en@@ abled that at a certain point in time , within the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world are essentially connected to each other ? </s>
yes . she doesn &apos;t make anything different than discover . </s>
if you want , it creates hyper@@ links between the images . </s>
and she does that because of the content in the images . </s>
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the abund@@ ance of the se@@ man@@ tic information that many of these images have . </s>
how if you take a web search for images where you give sent@@ ences and the text of the website has a lot of information about what image it is . </s>
but what if the picture would be connected to all of its images ? </s>
and then the scop@@ e of the se@@ man@@ tic cross and the abund@@ ance that comes out of it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network effect . </s>
bla@@ ise , this is really incredible . con@@ gr@@ atu@@ lations . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
and i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which i hope you have in mind with other things that you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections if you haven &apos;t noticed those . </s>
i want to start with what i call &quot; official do@@ g@@ ma . &quot; </s>
the official do@@ g@@ ma of what ? </s>
the official belief of all western industri@@ alized societies . </s>
the official do@@ g@@ ma works like this : if our goal is the ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zation of our citizens , this is all about ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the freedom of the individual . </s>
the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , meaningful , an un@@ prece@@ d@@ ented assu@@ mption for human beings . </s>
if people have freedom , then each of us will be ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zed for themselves to do the things that we ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze and nobody has for us . </s>
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice . </s>
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have . </s>
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that no one would get in the sense of questi@@ oning it . </s>
and it &apos;s also deeply ro@@ ot@@ ed in our lives . </s>
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress . </s>
this is my super@@ market . no big . </s>
i just want to say a little bit about sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing . </s>
there are 17@@ 5 d@@ res@@ ses in my super@@ market , if they don &apos;t count the 10 different extra o@@ live and 12 bal@@ ances that they could buy to make a large number of sal@@ ad dis@@ s@@ ings , in the im@@ prob@@ able case that none of the 17@@ 5 is right in the store for them . </s>
so that &apos;s what the super@@ market is . </s>
and then they go to the consumer electronics business to put together a stere@@ o -- lou@@ d@@ speakers , c@@ d player , a c@@ asse@@ tte player , radio , star@@ ter player , and in this one electronics there are so many stere@@ o facili@@ ties . </s>
we can put 6@@ .@@ 5 million different stere@@ o facili@@ ties into the components of the components that are offered in this business . </s>
you &apos;ve got to admit that this is a great choice . </s>
in other fields -- the world of communication . </s>
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could have every phone that you wanted , as long as it came from ma bell . </s>
you r@@ ented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it . go ahead . </s>
one consequence was that the telephone was never broken . </s>
those days are over . </s>
we have almost an infinite choice of tele@@ phones , especially in the world of mobile phones . </s>
these are the mobile phones of the future . </s>
my favorite is in the middle -- mp@@ three play@@ ful , no@@ is@@ y tri@@ mmer and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ ung l@@ é@@ e pa@@ é@@ e . </s>
and if you haven &apos;t seen this in your business yet , you can be sure you &apos;re going to get it soon . </s>
and what it does is it makes people walk into business and ask that question . </s>
now do you know what the answer to this question is ? </s>
the answer is &quot; no . &quot; </s>
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much . </s>
in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying the objects , the same explosion of choice is true of choice . </s>
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do . </s>
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could do a , or we could make b . </s>
a has these benefits and risks . </s>
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ? </s>
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot; </s>
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks . </s>
what do you want to do ? </s>
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot; </s>
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot; </s>
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonom@@ y . &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift in the bur@@ den of responsibility for someone who knows something -- nam@@ ely the doctor -- to someone who is nothing and most likely to be sick , and therefore not the best constit@@ ution is to make a decision -- nam@@ ely the patient . </s>
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for prescri@@ ption drugs for people like you and me , if you think about it , not at all , because we don &apos;t buy them . </s>
why do they do it for us if we can &apos;t buy ? </s>
and the answer is , they expect us to call the doctor to the next morning and ask for a change of prescri@@ ption . </s>
something as profound as our identity is now a matter of how this slide is going to show . </s>
we don &apos;t inher@@ it identity ; we invent it . </s>
and we are often inv@@ enting ourselves as much as we want . </s>
that means that every day , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be . </s>
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assu@@ mption was that almost everybody had one and they quickly married as fast as they could , and then got kids as fast as they could . </s>
the only true election was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that . </s>
today , it &apos;s all easy to have . </s>
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to do . </s>
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re less careful . </s>
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i mar@@ ry or not ? should i mar@@ ry ? </s>
should i mar@@ ry a mar@@ ry ? should i have children first , or should i have a career ? &quot; </s>
they &apos;re all questions they ask . </s>
and they will answer these questions regar@@ d@@ less of whether this is to do all the tasks i want to do and not get a good grade in my class . </s>
and in fact , they should . these are important questions . </s>
work -- we &apos;re bl@@ essed , as carl illu@@ strated , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every day on the planet -- to the rand@@ ol@@ ph hotel . </s>
by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about when the wir@@ es works . </s>
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it . </s>
so what it means is , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of working decisions , again and again and again , whether we should work or not work . </s>
we can look at our kids at football , and we have our mobile phone on a hip hip , and our black@@ berry on other hip hip , and our laptop probably probably on our la@@ p . </s>
and even if they &apos;re all shut down , every minute we &apos;re watching our child watching a football game of a football game , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i accept this call ? </s>
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot; </s>
and even though the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it will certainly be the experience of the football game of your child very different than it would have been . </s>
anywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a matter of choice . </s>
and the world that we lived in looked like this . </s>
this is what i want to say , there were some choices , but it wasn &apos;t all a question of choice . </s>
and the world in which we live now looks like this . </s>
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ? </s>
and the answer is &quot; yes . &quot; </s>
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to get what &apos;s bad about it . </s>
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people . </s>
one effect , parado@@ x@@ ically wise , is that he &apos;s paraly@@ zed instead of free . </s>
with so many options that you can choose , people fall very hard to decide . </s>
i &apos;m going to give you another dra@@ stic example of this , a study about invest@@ ments in volun@@ tary ages . </s>
a colleague of mine had access to investment records of van@@ gu@@ ard , the gigan@@ tic fund of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs . </s>
and what she found was a 10 investment fund that offered the emplo@@ yer by participa@@ tion by two percent . </s>
they &apos;re off@@ ering 50 investment fund -- 10 percent less employees than if they offer only five . why ? </s>
because it &apos;s 50 investment fund that &apos;s standing for choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you &apos;re going to pick it up tomorrow . </s>
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , of course never comes . </s>
you know , it &apos;s not just that people have to eat dog food when they go to the reti@@ rement reti@@ rement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to return , it also means the decision is so hard that they miss huge invest@@ ments of their emplo@@ yer . </s>
they don &apos;t spend until 5,000 dollars a year on the emplo@@ yment of the emplo@@ yer who would have been happy to re@@ cover their contribu@@ tion . </s>
paraly@@ sis is a consequence of many choices . </s>
and i think it makes the case that the world looks like this . </s>
you want to make the decision really well if it &apos;s for all e@@ ter@@ nity , right ? </s>
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or even the wrong sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing . </s>
so this is an effect . the other effect is that even when we make up the paraly@@ sis and make a decision , we end up less content with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities . </s>
and there are several reasons for this . </s>
one of them is probably through the vast selection of different sal@@ ad res@@ identi@@ ties , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , what sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different decision that would have been better . and what happened is this ima@@ ge-@@ scale alternative is that you regre@@ t the decision , and that regre@@ t seems to be negative to the happiness that you have made of your making decision , if it was a good decision . </s>
the more possibilities there are , the more simple it is to regre@@ t at all , that &apos;s disap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment to the choices they make . </s>
second , what economists call op@@ per@@ t@@ ant cost . </s>
dan gil@@ bert made a big point this morning by saying how much the way we evalu@@ ate things depends on what we &apos;re compar@@ ing to . </s>
well , if there are so many alterna@@ tives to consider , it is simply attra@@ cting to imagine attra@@ ctive attribu@@ tes of alterna@@ tives that make them less happy with the alterna@@ tives that they &apos;ve chosen . </s>
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze . </s>
but here &apos;s what they should have thought . </s>
so here &apos;s some on the ham@@ p@@ tons . </s>
very expensive real e@@ state . </s>
beautiful beach . great day . you &apos;ve got it all for yourself . </s>
what could be better ? &quot; dam@@ n the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august . </s>
everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is gone . </s>
i could park right in front of my house . &quot; </s>
and he sp@@ ends two weeks from the thought that he has missed the possibility of having a great parking lot day . </s>
op@@ per@@ t@@ ability costs down the happiness that we get through our choices , even if what we chose is fantastic . </s>
and the more possibilities there are for choice , the more attra@@ ctive tra@@ its of these choices are brought in to the op@@ per@@ tunnel cost . </s>
here &apos;s another example . </s>
well , this cartoon makes some stat@@ ements . </s>
it makes a statement about this right now , and maybe do things about it as well . </s>
but one more important thing he does is , always who you choose to do one thing , you don &apos;t decide to do other things . </s>
and these other things like a lot of attra@@ ctive features , and it will become what they &apos;re going to do less attra@@ ctive . </s>
thir@@ dly , es@@ cal@@ ation of expectations . </s>
this struck me when i wanted to share my je@@ ans . </s>
i &apos;m wearing je@@ ans , almost the whole time . </s>
and there was a time in which there was only je@@ ans , and they bought it , and they fit bad@@ ly , they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , and if they carried them long enough and wash@@ ed enough , they started to feel ok . </s>
so to buy new je@@ ans , after many years of tra@@ ding the old , and i said , &quot; i would like to have a couple of je@@ ans , here &apos;s my size . &quot; </s>
and the sal@@ es@@ man said , &quot; do you want sna@@ kes , do you want , or ligh@@ t@@ ning ? </s>
do you want butt@@ ons or clo@@ thing ? stone or ac@@ id or ac@@ id ? </s>
do you want to solve je@@ wel@@ s with holes ? </s>
if you want to cut down at the bottom , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h ... &quot; and so on , he told him . </s>
my ja@@ w was down , and after i got back , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like the way it used to be the only species . &quot; </s>
he had no idea what it was , so i spent an hour trying to try all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and i put the business -- and i tell the truth -- with the best pas@@ sage je@@ ans i &apos;d ever had . </s>
i had it better . all those choices allowed me to have better . </s>
but i felt worse . </s>
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself . </s>
and the reason i felt worse was that i felt worse with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good few je@@ ans were going up . </s>
i had very low expectations . i had no specific expectations when they were only in one way . </s>
when they came to 100 species , one of them should have been perfect . </s>
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect . </s>
and so i compared what i expected to get , and what i had been disap@@ poin@@ t@@ led to what i expected . </s>
adding opportunities to people in the lives of people inevi@@ t@@ ably increases the expectations that people have about how well these opportunities are going to be . </s>
and that leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good . </s>
no one in the marketing world knows this , because , if you would , you don &apos;t know what this is about . </s>
the truth is more like this . </s>
the reason is that everything was better than anything worse , when everything was worse , it was possible for people to make experiences that were a pleas@@ ant surprise . </s>
today , in the world that we live in -- we weal@@ thy , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfe@@ ction as an expec@@ tation -- the best you can ever hope to hope is as good as you expect it to . </s>
they &apos;re never going to be surprised because their expectations , my expectations , are domesti@@ c . </s>
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what they all got -- the secret to happiness is low expectations . </s>
i want to say -- a short auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really , really wonderful . </s>
i could not have done it better . i didn &apos;t let myself down . </s>
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , it &apos;s not always a bad thing . </s>
finally , a consequence of buying a bad sitting je@@ ans when there is only one way to buy , that when you &apos;re dis@@ satis@@ fied , and you wonder why who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could you do ? </s>
if hundreds of different kinds of je@@ ans are available , and they buy one that is disap@@ poin@@ ting , and they ask them why , who &apos;s responsible ? </s>
and it &apos;s also clear that the answer is , you know , it &apos;s the answer . </s>
you could have done it better . </s>
with 100 different kinds of je@@ ans in the j@@ el@@ ly , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes . </s>
and so when people make decisions , and even when the results of the decisions are good , they feel good about it , they acc@@ use themselves . </s>
clinical depression explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation . </s>
i think a significant one -- not the only , but a significant contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the disap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment because their standards are so high , and then , if you need to explain those experiences themselves , you think it &apos;s your fault . </s>
and so the visual result is that it generally makes us better , obje@@ ctive , and we feel worse . </s>
so let me remind you . </s>
this is the official do@@ g@@ ma , which we all think is completely wrong , is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true . </s>
there is no question that is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that the more choices are better than something . </s>
there &apos;s a ma@@ gical crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is . </s>
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time in terms of choo@@ sing our common good . </s>
now , as a basic question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a basic question , the thing about thinking about thinking , which is what all of these choices provide in the industri@@ alized societies , is the material that is wealth . </s>
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them whose problem is not too big choice . </s>
your problem is that you have too little . </s>
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies . </s>
and what &apos;s so fru@@ str@@ ating and anno@@ ying , steve levi@@ tt told you yesterday about how these expensive and hard car seats are not helping . it &apos;s a waste of money . </s>
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy they don &apos;t help . </s>
they even hurt . </s>
they &apos;re worried about what we are there for . </s>
if something from what the human society en@@ ables our society to make decisions in the societies where people would have moved too little choices , not only would improve people &apos;s lives , but our dignity will be impro@@ ved . </s>
economists call this a par@@ e@@ to impro@@ v@@ ements . </s>
the income distribution will make it all better -- not just the poor -- because all this great choice is pla@@ in us . </s>
finally , check this cartoon , and a highly developed person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ? &quot; </s>
they don &apos;t know anything about this gold@@ fish glass . &quot; </s>
im@@ pover@@ ished imagination , a shor@@ t-@@ term view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first . </s>
and the more i thought about it , the more i came to view that the fish knows something . </s>
because the truth is , if you break the gold@@ fish glass so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paraly@@ sis . </s>
if they break the gold@@ fish glass , so anything is possible , they lower the happiness . </s>
they increase the paraly@@ sis and they lower the happiness . </s>
everyone needs a gold@@ fish glass . </s>
this is almost limited to limited security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us . </s>
but the ab@@ sen@@ ce of a metaph@@ or@@ ical gold@@ fish glass is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ ery , and , i guess , disaster . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes . </s>
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing and building new lives . </s>
we &apos;ve always been trying to ask significant questions . </s>
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels . </s>
we &apos;ve tried a different approach to simpli@@ fy it into the mar@@ g@@ in@@ al components . </s>
we &apos;ve di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed almost 20 years , and when we sequen@@ ced the human genome from the analo@@ g of the analo@@ g world of biology into the digital world of the computer . </s>
now , let &apos;s try to ask if we can re@@ generate life , or whether we can create new lives , from this digital universe . </s>
this is the map of a small organism , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma pal@@ tal@@ ium , which has the small@@ est genome of a species that can repli@@ cate itself in the lab , and we tried to do that with an even smaller genome . </s>
we managed to do it in about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that &apos;s here . </s>
but if we look at this metaboli@@ c map that &apos;s very simple , compared to our own , trust me , it &apos;s simple , but if we look at all of these genes that we can elimin@@ ate one by the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell . </s>
and so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to actually synthes@@ ize that chromo@@ some , which allows us to v@@ ary the individual components and ask some of those fundamental questions . </s>
and so we started with the question , can we synthes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ? </s>
does chemistry allow chemistry to create these really big molecules that have never been done before ? </s>
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromo@@ some ? </s>
a chromo@@ some is just one piece of an in@@ t@@ act chemical material by the way . </s>
our steps in di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zation of life were exponenti@@ al . </s>
our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , but our final point would be on an exponenti@@ al curve . </s>
we started 15 years ago . </s>
it actually took a few years to start with a bio@@ ethical event before we did the first experiments . </s>
as it turns out , dna synthes@@ ti@@ zation is very difficult . </s>
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world capable of making the small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a de@@ cep@@ tive process , so the longer you make a piece , the more er@@ rors are happening . </s>
so we had to develop a new method that we could put together these little pieces and correct the mistakes . </s>
that was our first trial , starting with the digital information , the genome ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 . </s>
it &apos;s a small virus of the bacteria . </s>
we made little pieces , we made a error correc@@ tion , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters . </s>
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it into a bacteri@@ um , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles . </s>
the viral particles were then released from the cells , and came back and killed e. col@@ i . </s>
i recently talked to the oil industry recently , and they said that they were really ne@@ gle@@ cting this model . </s>
they laugh@@ ed more than you did here . </s>
so we think that this is a situation in which software can actually build their own hardware in a biological system . </s>
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some , and it had more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters genetic code , so we thought we could build it in ta@@ pes from the size of the virus that we could vari@@ ed the size of the c@@ asse@@ tte to understand what the individual components of a living cell are . </s>
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information has to be really accurate . </s>
when we first sequen@@ ced the genome first in 199@@ 5 , the error rate was a mistake per 10,000 base pa@@ irs per 10,000 base pa@@ irs . </s>
we found that we found 30 mistakes . if we used to use the original sequence of original sequence , it would never have been possible . </s>
so part of the design is to make pieces of the 50 letters long and over@@ la@@ p with other 50-@@ letter pieces of pieces to build smaller sub-@@ bits of sub-@@ units to build those together . </s>
we &apos;ve built unique elements here . </s>
you may have heard that we built water@@ marks . </s>
think about it : we have a 4@@ -@@ letter code : a , c , g and t. </s>
tri@@ ple@@ ts of these letters -- these letters are about 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amin@@ o aci@@ ds . </s>
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sent@@ ences , thoughts . </s>
ini@@ tially , we just signed signed . </s>
some people were disap@@ pointed that it wasn &apos;t a poetry . </s>
we have engine@@ ered the pieces that we could just dis@@ semin@@ ate them with enzy@@ mes , and there are enzy@@ mes that repair it and put it back together . </s>
and we &apos;ve started making pieces , starting with gap@@ s with pieces of se@@ vent@@ h letters , adding these together to make 24@@ ,@@ 000-@@ letter pieces to put them back together , up to 7@@ 2,000 . </s>
in each step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces in the sur@@ vei@@ llan@@ ce so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process that they &apos;ll see in a minute . </s>
we tried to get at the point of auto@@ mation . </s>
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball pla@@ yo@@ ff . </s>
when we get to these really big pieces -- over 100,000 base pa@@ irs -- and then they &apos;re not just growing in e. col@@ i , it &apos;s all over modern molecular biology , and so we &apos;re moving other mechanis@@ ms into different mechanis@@ ms . </s>
we knew about a mechanism called hom@@ ologist re@@ combination , which uses biology to repair dna that can put those pieces together . </s>
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ cus radio@@ dur@@ ans of the three million wheel radiation . </s>
you can see in the upper field that his chromo@@ some just goes apart . </s>
12 to 24 hours later , everything has put it back together as it was going on . </s>
we have thousands of organisms that can do this . </s>
these organisms can be completely dri@@ ed , they can even live in the vac@@ uum . </s>
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and can move , looking for a@@ qua@@ tic conditions . </s>
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there . </s>
here &apos;s a sense of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve only used he@@ fe@@ -@@ mechanism mechanis@@ ms with the real design of the pieces , we &apos;ve adap@@ ted them , and then we put them together automatically . </s>
this is not an electr@@ on micro@@ graph , it &apos;s a regular micro@@ graph . </s>
it &apos;s such a large molecule that we can even see it with the light microscope . </s>
this is footage over a period of six seconds . </s>
this is the audience that we just finished recently . </s>
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters in genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure that was ever created by humans . </s>
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million . </s>
if we looked at it with a no@@ vel@@ ty of 10 and no pa@@ ths , it would take 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code . </s>
well , how do we start a chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate it ? </s>
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated than dealing with bacteria . </s>
it &apos;s as simple as if you &apos;re in eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ on@@ ia , like we &apos;re doing it : you just take out the nucle@@ us and get it in there , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the c@@ lon@@ es . </s>
arch@@ ae@@ bacteria is integr@@ ating the chromo@@ some into the cell , but only recently we &apos;ve shown that you can take a full transplan@@ tation of a chromo@@ some from one cell to another , and activ@@ ate that activ@@ ation . </s>
we clean@@ ed the chromo@@ some of a micro@@ bi@@ al species . gro@@ ve said these two are as far as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to choose this chromo@@ some . we put it in enzy@@ mes to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and you &apos;ll estimate our very sophisticated graph@@ s here . </s>
the new chromo@@ some went into the cell . </s>
in fact , we thought that there was the end , but we were trying to get the process a little bit further . </s>
that &apos;s the main mechanism of evolution here . </s>
we find all sorts of species here that have taken a second chromo@@ some or a third of any , each time thousands of characteristics in only one second to a species of a species . </s>
now , people who think of evolution as a gene that are changed at a time have changed a lot from biology . </s>
there are enzy@@ mes called the restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that actually di@@ gest dna . </s>
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell was neither ; the chromosom@@ es that we put in . </s>
it was ex@@ pri@@ ded in the cell , and realized the other chromo@@ some as a foreign material , and so we had only one cell with a new chromo@@ some . </s>
it ble@@ w up blue because of the genes that we added . </s>
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and conver@@ ted completely into a new species based on the new software that we gave into the cell cell . </s>
all the proteins changed the membran@@ es -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we trans@@ fer@@ red . </s>
it may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ chim@@ ies , but we can move the software dna , change things quite dramatically . </s>
now i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that this is not the gen@@ esis -- this is based on 3.@@ 5 billion years of evolution . </s>
and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we may be creating a new form of cam@@ brian explosion where there could be a massive new biological education based on this digital design . </s>
why should we care ? </s>
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need . </s>
we &apos;re growing from six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years . </s>
to put it in my context , i was born in 194@@ 6 . </s>
today , three people on this planet have existed for everyone in 194@@ 6 ; within 40 years , it will be four . </s>
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , 6@@ .@@ 5 billion people . </s>
it will offer a challenge for 9 . </s>
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30 plus billions billion oil oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million bar@@ rel@@ s a day . </s>
when we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge . </s>
and then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that &apos;s going to land in the atmosphere . </s>
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a datab@@ ase of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future . </s>
the electronics industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of this . </s>
and we &apos;re pri@@ mar@@ ily moving into the limits of biological reality and that of our imagination . </s>
we have technologies today because of these fast synthes@@ i@@ ties to do what we call combin@@ at@@ or@@ ic gene@@ tics . </s>
we have now the ability to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosom@@ es a day . </s>
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes or optimi@@ zing these processes to make oc@@ tan@@ e or drugs new vaccin@@ es , we can change with a small team of more molecular biology than the last 20 years . </s>
and it &apos;s only selection : we can selec@@ tively selec@@ tively selec@@ tively selec@@ te production , production of chemicals or fuel production and so on . </s>
this is an image of effective design software that we &apos;re working on with actually designing and designing new species on the computer and designing the computer on the computer . </s>
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly what the genetic code is going to look like . </s>
we &apos;re now focusing on fuels of the fourth generation . </s>
you &apos;ve recently seen corn ethan@@ ol what &apos;s just a bad experiment . </s>
we have fuels of the second and the third generation that will come out relatively soon , that much higher sugar , like oc@@ tober or different kinds of bu@@ tan@@ ol . </s>
but , as we think , the only way for biology to have a huge impact of the cost of the cost of food or limit@@ ing its avail@@ ability is when we see co2 as a source material , and so we &apos;re working on cells that go this way . </s>
and we think that we will be the first to be with the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and this is about 18 months . </s>
sunlight and co2 are a method . </s>
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways . </s>
this is an organism that we &apos;ve described in 199@@ 6 . </s>
it lives in the deep sea , about one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half miles deep , with almost hot water temper@@ atures . </s>
it trans@@ f@@ ers co2 into methan@@ e under the use of hydrogen source . </s>
we study whether we can use stor@@ ed co2 , which may simply be brought to production , conver@@ t the co2 into fuel to drive this process . </s>
in a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life . </s>
you know , we really -- moder@@ ate tar@@ gets such as the replac@@ ement of all the pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry , right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? a main source of energy . </s>
but that &apos;s the way we &apos;re working right now to bring the same approach@@ es to the development of vaccin@@ es . </s>
you &apos;ve seen it this year with the flu , we &apos;re always in the back , and we &apos;ve got a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine . </s>
i think that can be changed by creating re@@ mix@@ ing vaccin@@ es in the sub@@ ur@@ bs . </s>
this is what the future might look like with changes , can now acceler@@ ate the evolution of evolution with synthetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ ans , and perhaps eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ tes . </s>
we are light years away from impro@@ ving people , and our goal is simply that we have a chance to survive long enough to survive . thank you very much . </s>
in the last ted conference , i gave a introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c . </s>
and i promis@@ ed to come back to explain how the machine works . </s>
so , it &apos;s so far . and for those of you who haven &apos;t been there , the l@@ h@@ c is the biggest scientific experiment that has ever been done -- 27 miles in diam@@ eter . </s>
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe -- and that up to 600 million times in a second . </s>
it &apos;s just brea@@ th@@ taking . </s>
this is the machine below gen@@ ev@@ a . </s>
we take pictures of these mini@@ -@@ big bang in dete@@ ctors . </s>
this is one i work on . it &apos;s called the at@@ las dete@@ ctor -- 4@@ 4 meters across the surface , 22 meters in diam@@ eter . </s>
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the at@@ las in construction so you can see the scale . </s>
on september 10 , last year , the machine ran for the first time . </s>
and this picture was taken by at@@ las . </s>
it involves huge ju@@ g@@ gling in the control room . </s>
it &apos;s a picture of the first ray of light that went back to the l@@ h@@ c to the l@@ h@@ c , colli@@ ding with a part of the l@@ h@@ c to make a rain of particles pr@@ as@@ sing onto the dete@@ ctor . </s>
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a big tri@@ um@@ ph . </s>
i don &apos;t know if this created the biggest ju@@ g@@ gling , or this , when someone went to the google side and the front page was like this . </s>
it means that we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific achie@@ vement . </s>
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had been done with these wir@@ es -- these golden wir@@ es here . </s>
these wir@@ es lead 13@@ -@@ thousands when the machine goes on to high-@@ performance . </s>
now , the engineers among you will look at them and say , &quot; no you don &apos;t . these are little wir@@ es . &quot; </s>
you can do that because if you cool them very far , they become what they call super@@ conduc@@ tors . </s>
at minus 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , cool@@ er than the room between the stars , these wir@@ es can hold the tension . </s>
in one of the connections , between over nin@@ e-@@ thousand magne@@ ts in the l@@ h@@ c , there was a manu@@ f@@ o defe@@ ct . </s>
that he@@ ats the wir@@ es slightly and 13@@ -@@ thousand am@@ pl@@ ates suddenly en@@ counter@@ ed electrical resistance . </s>
this was the result . </s>
now , this is even more powerful if you think that the magne@@ ts wei@@ gh over 20 tons , shif@@ ted by about 30 inches . </s>
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of the magne@@ ts . </s>
and they had to take away what we did . </s>
we condi@@ tioned them , re@@ pa@@ i@@ red them . </s>
they &apos;re all back in their way . </s>
by the end of march , the l@@ h@@ c will be working again . </s>
we &apos;re going to turn it off , and collect first data from june or ju@@ ly , and continue our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are . </s>
now , of course , in a way , in a way , the debate about the value of science and engineering and engineering on these lines is easy . it &apos;s easy to dis@@ miss like that . </s>
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our limit@@ ations is the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c . </s>
i &apos;m going to leave my final scientist with a english scientist . hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y da@@ vy , who , as i guess , was defen@@ ding the us@@ eless experiments of his school , his app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce was michael far@@ a@@ day , which said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human spirit , as accep@@ table that our scientific ideas are end@@ ur@@ ous , that there &apos;s no mystery in nature that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ as are whole , and that there &apos;s no new worlds to con@@ front . &quot; </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;m a writer . </s>
writing books is my prof@@ ession , but it &apos;s , of course , more than that . </s>
it &apos;s also my big , li@@ fel@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation . </s>
and i don &apos;t expect that that will ever change . </s>
but shor@@ tly , shor@@ t-@@ term in my life and my career is happening to re@@ think my relationship to this work completely . </s>
this weird event was that recently i wrote a book -- a bi@@ ograph@@ y called gui@@ des , pra@@ y , love love -- that , unlike all of my previous books , went out into the world and became a big mega@@ -@@ event , international pol@@ lin@@ ator thing . </s>
and the result is that no matter where i come from , i &apos;m going to be treated as if i &apos;m a member of the day . </s>
seriously -- the cra@@ w@@ ling ! </s>
for example , they come up to me and they say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear you &apos;re not going to meet this success ? </s>
don &apos;t you fear that you as@@ sign your whole life and never create a book that interests anyone in the world ? never again ? &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
okay , that makes really courage . </s>
it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i would remember that over 20 years ago , when i first told me that i wanted to be the first time i wanted to be faced with the same kind of fear of fear . </s>
people said , don &apos;t you fear never to have succe@@ e@@ ded ? </s>
don &apos;t you fear that you kill the humili@@ ty of the humili@@ ation ? </s>
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to walk away your life for your life and never get anything done , and you &apos;re going to die in a ro@@ tt@@ ed dreams of dreams -- your mouth filled with the bit@@ ter ash of failure ? &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
you know , you know , you know . </s>
and the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , go ahead . </s>
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things . </s>
and i &apos;ve always had it . </s>
and i &apos;ve got a lot more fear that no one would know , that would be true . </s>
like al@@ ga@@ e -- and other frighten@@ ing things . </s>
but , when it comes to writing , i think i &apos;ve been thinking about this for a second , and i wonder , why ? </s>
is that reas@@ onable ? </s>
is it obvious that someone should expect to be expected to do the work that he feels he feels like ? </s>
and what about the creative entrepren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al enter@@ prise that they &apos;re un@@ comfortable with the mu@@ tual state of mind -- in a way that other jobs don &apos;t do ? </s>
my father , for example , was a chem@@ ist , and i can &apos;t remember any situation in his 40 years as a chem@@ ist in which he was asked to be afraid to be chem@@ ist . </s>
with your chem@@ ist block , john -- how do you do that ? </s>
it just wasn &apos;t going , you know ? </s>
but to be fair -- the chem@@ ist of the chem@@ ist has not given the reputation of al@@ co@@ hol man@@ ual depressed people . </s>
but we writers seem to have this kind of call , but not just the writers , but the creative gen@@ ital , seem to have this call , to be mentally un@@ stable . </s>
all they have to do is look at the bit@@ ter death rates of really great minds alone from the 20th century , who died young and often died of their own hand . </s>
and even the ones that didn &apos;t actually give death , seemed to be really ne@@ gle@@ cted by their tal@@ ents . </s>
nor@@ man ma@@ iler said shor@@ tly before his death in his last interview , and every one of my books has killed me a little bit further . </s>
an extraordinary statement that you can do about your life . </s>
but we don &apos;t even realize if we hear somebody like this , because we know this sort of thing for so long for a long time , somehow we &apos;ve accep@@ ted the perception and collective and suffering that somehow creativity and suffering and suffering -- and that art -- at the end of the day -- is always leading to the sea of the sea . </s>
the question i want to ask everybody here today is , is this idea for you completely fine ? </s>
do you feel like that ? because with just one centi@@ meter away , i don &apos;t feel comfortable with that idea at all . </s>
i think it &apos;s ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating . </s>
and i find them dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch them take over the next century . </s>
i find it better if we live our great creative encoura@@ gement . </s>
and i definitely know it would be for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start this dark path , this dark path@@ way -- especially in the way that i find myself in my career in my career . </s>
this is -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old . </s>
i may have been in my work for another 40 years . </s>
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from the world now is based on the world as the work that came out of my last book success , right ? </s>
i say it really , because we &apos;re all kind of a friends here -- it &apos;s extremely likely that my greatest success is behind me . </s>
oh , jesus , what a thought ! </s>
this is the kind of thought that someone can get to drink at 9 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want that . </s>
i &apos;d rather do this work that i love . </s>
so the question is : how ? </s>
so after some time of refle@@ cting the refle@@ ction that i think i can continue to write , i need to design a kind of sh@@ are@@ hol@@ der psychological constructed . </s>
somehow , i need to find a way to write a safe distance between me and my very natural gl@@ ance about how the reaction is going to be on the side of the writing . </s>
while i was looking for models last year to do this , i also looked in the past , and i tried to find other societies to see if they might have had better or more rational ideas about how to help deal with creative risks with the emotional risks that connect with creativity . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
this quest led me to the ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and the old ro@@ me . </s>
please join me , because the circle will end again . </s>
but in the ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ro@@ me , people have never believed that creativity comes from people , ok ? </s>
they believed that creativity was a kind of di@@ vine di@@ ener@@ ity , which is from a distant , unknown source to people -- from un@@ explained , unknown reasons . </s>
the gre@@ e@@ ks called these di@@ vine di@@ ener@@ y spi@@ ri@@ ts of creativity demon@@ str@@ ating . </s>
soc@@ rates is known that he thought he had a demon@@ stra@@ tive demon@@ str@@ ating him from further away from him . </s>
the roman had the same idea , called this sort of body of body creative spirit of genius . </s>
that &apos;s great . the roman@@ s didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual . </s>
they believed that a genius was this kind of ma@@ gical di@@ vine creature believed that it was literally living in the walls of an artist &apos;s walls -- sort of like do@@ bby , the house of house -- the ki@@ d@@ ne@@ ys and the artist at the work of work would be invisible , and make the result of the work . </s>
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work . </s>
and everybody knew it worked that way , right ? </s>
the artist &apos;s artist was protected about things like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism , right ? </s>
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t watch it all for you , and everybody knew that you had this physical genius that helped you . </s>
if your work was working -- not entirely your mistakes , right ? </s>
everybody knew your genius was a little l@@ ame . </s>
that &apos;s how really the west people have thought about creativity in the west for a long time . </s>
and then the ren@@ ais@@ s@@ ance came , and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- about all the go@@ ds and myster@@ ies , and there &apos;s no room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures that would take orders from di@@ vin@@ ity . </s>
it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely out of its own individual . </s>
for the first time in this story , you &apos;ll hear people called this genius , or these artists -- instead of having a genius . </s>
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake . </s>
you know ? i think a m@@ ere person to allow him to think that he thinks he or she is like the ves@@ sel , like the bas@@ in and the essen@@ ce , and the source of all di@@ vine , creative , unknown , infinite mysteri@@ ous mysteri@@ ous mysteri@@ ous mysteri@@ ous mysteri@@ ous mysteri@@ ous mystery is a little bit too much responsibility for off@@ ering them a fra@@ c@@ tious , human mind . </s>
it &apos;s like asking someone to s@@ wal@@ low the sun . </s>
that dis@@ plays and di@@ stor@@ ted e@@ gos , and it creates all of these in@@ accessible expectations of success to success . </s>
i think that this success@@ fully pressure pressure our artists of the last 500 years of the last 500 years . </s>
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- here &apos;s the question . </s>
can we change it ? </s>
perhaps to return to an aging understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative . </s>
maybe not . </s>
maybe we can &apos;t just ex@@ tend rational human@@ ism for 500 years of rational human@@ ism in an 18@@ -@@ minute talk . </s>
and there are certainly people in this audience who would really raise the scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- fe@@ a@@ thers that follow people and apply fe@@ a@@ thers on their projects and so on . </s>
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey . </s>
but the question that i want to throw up is , why not ? </s>
why not think about it ? </s>
because it makes as much sense as anything i &apos;ve heard from when it comes to explaining the absolutely crazy mo@@ bility of the creative process . </s>
a process that -- like everyone who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , actually everyone here -- they don &apos;t always move reas@@ on@@ ably sensi@@ bly . </s>
in fact , he can feel sometimes really par@@ an@@ e@@ ous . </s>
i recently had one such encounter as i met the extraordinary american poet poet ru@@ th stone , who was now over 90 , but she told me that when she was growing up in the village in virginia , she told me that when she was working in the village in virginia , she said she would feel and hear how a poem can come across the landscape of the landscape . </s>
she said it would be like a don@@ or train train . </s>
it would roll across the land on her . </s>
she felt when it came , because it would take the earth under her feet . </s>
she knew that at one point she could do only one thing , and that was -- in her words -- in her words -- they run like the de@@ vil . </s>
she ran like the de@@ vil to the house while she was tra@@ cked by this poem , and it was only because she had to get fast enough to a piece of paper and a pen@@ cil , so that when it went through it , she could catch it through her th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly , and hold on her sheet . </s>
in other paint , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and the poem roll@@ ed through her , and she missed it . she said it would continue to move on land and -- as she said -- another poet search for another poet . </s>
and then there were these moments -- the part is i &apos;m never going to forget -- she said that there were moments in which they almost missed it . </s>
so , she runs into the house , and she sear@@ ches for the paper , and the poem goes through her , and she grab@@ s a pen just as it pas@@ ses through her , and then -- she said -- it was like having to reach with her other hand and get it . </s>
she caught the poem on his tail , and she pulled it back into her body , and took it on the piece of paper . </s>
in those opportunities , the poem came out and in@@ t@@ act in@@ t@@ act on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first word . </s>
when i heard that , i thought this was in@@ san@@ e -- that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is going on . </s>
it &apos;s not like my creative process at all -- i &apos;m not the channel ! </s>
i &apos;m a mou@@ th@@ ful . in order to work , i have to stand up at the same time at the same time and swe@@ at every day , and really un@@ comfortable and really un@@ comfortable . </s>
but even in my wall even species , sometimes i made this thing up . </s>
and i guess many of you have done that too . </s>
even i had work or ideas that went out of a source through me that i really can &apos;t identify . </s>
what is a thing for ? </s>
and how do we deal with this relationship without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in the opposite with intellectual health ? </s>
for me , the best living example of how you can do this can be done by the musicians tom wa@@ his . i &apos;ve been able to interview him a few years ago for a magazine . </s>
we talked about this issue . and you know what ? most of his life was tom , tom artist &apos;s em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of modern artist , who tried to domin@@ ate these un@@ controlled creative impul@@ ses that lived in him and deal with them . </s>
but then he got older and quiet , and he told me that one day he went to a ra@@ il@@ road store in los angeles , and that changed everything for him . </s>
he was driving at high speed when he suddenly heard a little frag@@ ment of a melo@@ dy , which is often difficult for him to be difficult for him to be difficult for him , and he wants to have it . she &apos;s pra@@ ying . he le@@ ans on afterwards , but he can &apos;t touch her . </s>
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a c@@ asse@@ tte record . </s>
so he &apos;s starting to get up this old war@@ ning in him , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;ll be tra@@ cked by this song on forever . </s>
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it . right ? </s>
but instead of getting pan@@ ic , he just stopped . </s>
he finished all the thought , and he did something completely new . </s>
and he just looked up at the sky , and he said , do you see me driving my car driving ? </s>
do i look like i could just write a song ? </s>
if you really want to exist , come back to a low-@@ cost moment when i can take care of you . </s>
if you don &apos;t , qu@@ eu@@ e somebody else &apos;s qu@@ eu@@ es today . </s>
go and squ@@ aw@@ k leon@@ ard co@@ hen . </s>
his whole work process has changed this way . </s>
not the work itself . it was often as dark as e@@ h and ever . </s>
but the process and the heavy war@@ ning that surro@@ unding it was li@@ t when he took the genius out of it , where he didn &apos;t take anything as a doctor , and let him go back to where he came from , and he realized that there must be no intern@@ alized , ag@@ oni@@ zing thing . </s>
it could give an ow@@ ner@@ ship , wonder , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the foreign , ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating thing that was not quite tom . </s>
when i heard this story , it also changed the way i worked , and it saved me once . </s>
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing process , pra@@ y , pra@@ y love , and i noticed in one of the doubt of the doubt that we all fall , when we &apos;re working on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you know , you start to think it &apos;s a disaster . this is going to be the worst book ever written . </s>
not just bad , but the worst of all time . </s>
i began to think i should just re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the project . </s>
but then i remember@@ ed how tom was talking to the free sky , and i tried . </s>
so i raised my view of the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt , and i talked to my comm@@ entary towards a empty corner corner of the room . </s>
i said , &quot; listen , listen , you know , you and i know both if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ? </s>
because you see that i have everything i have , investment . i don &apos;t have any more than that . </s>
so if you want to do it better , you &apos;ve got to open up here and hold your propor@@ tion of it . </s>
okay . but if you don &apos;t , you know what , then you know what the hell is . </s>
i &apos;m still going to write further , because that &apos;s my job . </s>
and i want to just give you a proto@@ co@@ l that i &apos;ve been here for my part of the job today . </s>
because -- at the end , it &apos;s like , at the end of centuries , in the deser@@ ti@@ fication of north africa , people have gather@@ ed sacred dan@@ ces of hol@@ y dan@@ ces and music for hours that were held for hours -- until the da@@ wn . </s>
these fe@@ a@@ thers were always great , because the dan@@ cers were professional , and they were fantastic . </s>
but again , very rare , something special happened . one of the things that happened was one of the actors that was actually se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated . </s>
and i know you know what i mean , because i know that all of you in your life have seen a performance like this in your life . </s>
it was as though the time was still , and the dan@@ cers were moving through a kind of p@@ ale , and he did not actually do anything different than he ever did before -- 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but it was all moving together . </s>
and all of a sudden , he no longer seemed to be in human human . </s>
it was li@@ fted up by the inside and ill@@ umin@@ ated from the bottom , and everything ble@@ w up through a di@@ vine fire . </s>
when something happened at the time , people knew what it was . they called it his name . </s>
they put the hands together , and they started singing : who@@ al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god , god , god . </s>
this is god , you know ? </s>
interesting histor@@ ic foot@@ note : when the mo@@ tions of southern spa@@ in con@@ qu@@ ered them , they changed this practice . the language changed over the course of the centuries of app@@ al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , which you still hear about ma@@ ting and fl@@ am@@ en@@ co dan@@ ces . </s>
if a sing@@ er in spa@@ in has something impossible , something ma@@ gical done , ol@@ al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , great , bra@@ vo &apos; day , there &apos;s a gli@@ mp@@ se , it &apos;s a gli@@ mp@@ se of god . </s>
and that &apos;s great , because we need that . </s>
but , the tri@@ cky part follo@@ ws the next morning , when the dan@@ cer wa@@ kes up and realized that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;@@ clock on a tu@@ es@@ day -- and he no longer has a fifth of god in himself . </s>
it &apos;s mer@@ ely an aging mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ge with painful k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe it will never go back to those hei@@ ghts . </s>
and maybe somebody will never call any god name when he sp@@ ins . but what should he do with the rest of his life ? </s>
it &apos;s hard . </s>
this is one of the most painful correc@@ tions of a creative life . </s>
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be that full of embarras@@ sing , if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning , that the extraordinary aspects of your existence came from them . </s>
if you may just believe that you &apos;re a lo@@ an -- an incredibly uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able source of your life , that will be passed on somebody else , when you &apos;re done with it . </s>
when we start thinking about this , this changes everything . </s>
so i started thinking , and so i think with certainty over the past few months , while i was working on the book that will appear soon -- as the dangerous , frighten@@ ing , stron@@ g@@ ly expected after@@ ward of my des@@ k@@ top success . </s>
the thing i have to tell myself all the time when i get crazy about it is , don &apos;t worry . </s>
don &apos;t be da@@ un@@ ted . </s>
just do your job . </s>
it will continue for your contribu@@ tion , whatever it is , whatever it is . </s>
if your job is dancing , dance . </s>
if the stupid di@@ vine genius that you put on the side is deci@@ ding for a short moment of wonder through your effort to show your effort through your effort , then ol@@ é ! okay ! </s>
and if you don &apos;t , dance still your dance . </s>
and indeed ol@@ é ! let &apos;s do it for all of you . </s>
i believe in it , and i feel like we should teach . </s>
fur@@ é ol@@ é ! you know , despite all that , just for you , that you have the only human love and self-@@ meaning to be there . </s>

last year , i showed these two slides to illu@@ strate that the arctic ice cap@@ s , which for nearly three million years had had the size of the lower 48 states shr@@ in@@ king by 40 percent . </s>
but that doesn &apos;t mean much enough to do the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thi@@ ck@@ ness of the ice . </s>
in a certain sense , the arctic ice is the be@@ ating heart of our global climate system . </s>
it grows in winter and shr@@ in@@ king summer . </s>
so the next slide that i &apos;m showing you is a ti@@ me-@@ lap@@ se that has happened in the last 25 years . </s>
the permanent ice is lab@@ eled with red . </s>
as you can see , it &apos;s growing on the dark blue -- this is the an@@ nu@@ al ice in the winter , and it &apos;s shr@@ in@@ king in the summer . </s>
the so-called permanent ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood fli@@ pped out of the body here . </s>
in 25 years , it will be gone from here to here . </s>
this is a problem because the warming of the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , where there are huge amounts of frozen carbon , which is when it &apos;s consum@@ ed from microbes to methan@@ e . </s>
compared to the entire amount of climate change material in the atmosphere , it could double that amount when we cross this critical point . </s>

you &apos;re fine . the question is how will it take us ? </s>
and one reason is this enormous heat range war@@ ning green@@ land from the north . </s>
this is an an@@ nu@@ al tra@@ w@@ l . </s>
but the volume is much bigger than ever before . </s>
this is the can@@ ger@@ l@@ us@@ a@@ q river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land . </s>
if you want to know how the sea level goes through state ice level , it goes up to the sea here . </s>
these ri@@ vers are getting ra@@ pid . </s>
on the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tica , the largest ic@@ e@@ berg on the planet . </s>
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent has a negative ice sheet . </s>

40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from this mel@@ ting water . </s>
in the an@@ gles , this gl@@ aci@@ er is the drinking source for this city . </s>
the amount of water has been expanding . </s>
but if you look down , most of the drinking water will fall away . </s>

four times over the last 30 years , as in the previous 7@@ 0s . </s>
this is a perfectly un@@ sustainable development pattern . </s>
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does . </s>
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans . </s>
if you look at the area of the eastern pacific area , from the american continent , western and both across the indian sub@@ continent , where there &apos;s a dra@@ stic decline in the oxygen in the ocean . </s>
the biggest single factor for global warming , next to de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels . </s>
oil is a problem , and coal is the most equally biggest problem . </s>
the united states is one of the two largest players , combined with china . </s>
and the pro@@ pos@@ al was to build many more carbon fac@@ tories . </s>
but we &apos;re starting to see a change . </s>
here are the ones that were painted in the last few years with some green alterna@@ tives that were pro@@ posed . </s>
not@@ ation is a political dis@@ position in our country . </s>
and the co@@ vers and the o@@ zone du@@ cks have spent a quarter of a billion dollars last cal@@ end@@ ar last cal@@ end@@ ar , which is a clean coal , which is a con@@ tradi@@ ction . </s>
this picture reminded me of something . </s>
around christmas , i walked at home in ten@@ nes@@ see , a billion tons of hot light lam@@ b . </s>
they &apos;ve seen it in the news news . </s>
this is in our entire country of the second largest waste flow in america . </s>
this happened to christmas day . </s>
one of the commer@@ ci@@ als of the dr@@ um industry for christmas was this one . </s>

this is the source of most coal in west virginia . </s>
the most powerful min@@ er is the director of mas@@ sey coal . </s>
let me say one very clear : al gore , nan@@ cy pel@@ o@@ si , harry rei@@ d , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . </s>
so the alli@@ ance for climate protection has launched two campaig@@ ns in life . </s>
this is one , part of it . </s>
at co@@ al@@ ence , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business . </s>
that &apos;s why we set ourselves to the top line , to give a significant amount of money to get an ad on the way to get the truth over coal . </s>
in fact , coal is not dirty . </s>
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it sm@@ ells good , too , too . </s>
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change . </s>
let &apos;s leave that to us . </s>
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . </s>
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean carbon factory . </s>
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud . </s>
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology . </s>
and yet the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is the remark@@ ably clean carbon technology that you see here , changes everything . </s>
if you look at it carefully , this is the current clean coal technology . </s>
finally , the positive alternative mix@@ es with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security . </s>
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis . </s>
the red thre@@ ad that conne@@ cts all of those , is our depen@@ dence on carb@@ on-@@ based fuels such as dirty coal and foreign oil . </s>
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from that mis@@ si@@ le situation . </s>
care with 100 percent clean electricity , over the next 10 years , over the next 10 years . </s>
a plan to bring america back to work , make us sa@@ fer and to help us stop global warming . </s>
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems . </s>
care america . find out more . </s>
this is the last . </s>
it &apos;s about a new supply of america . </s>
one of the fa@@ stest ways , our depen@@ dence on old , dirty fuels , that make up our world to reduce our world . </s>
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system . </s>
new invest@@ ments in order to create well-@@ paid jobs . </s>
care america . it &apos;s time to accept reality . </s>
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone . </s>
if you want to get far , go together . &quot; </s>
we have to get far , fast , fast . </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;d like to start asking you to think of the time of your childhood when you were playing with building blocks . </s>
while they realized how to stre@@ tch out the hands and ac@@ cur@@ ately pick up the cla@@ ims , they actually learned how to think and understand problems by understanding and change space . </s>
spa@@ tial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand most of our environment . </s>
as a computer scientist , inspired by the way we interact with real objects -- along with my scientist pat@@ ti and my colleagues je@@ ev@@ an kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i , i began to wonder : what if we were using computers , instead of a mouse finger@@ ti@@ mber , that moves like a digital finger@@ ti@@ cker on a flat surface -- -- what if we could interven@@ e with both hands and put them in data and put them in the way that we want it ? </s>
this question was so comp@@ elling that we evolved to explore the answer of the answer and si@@ z@@ able . </s>
in short , a si@@ de-@@ able computer is an interactive computer in the size of a coo@@ k@@ ie . </s>
they can be moved by the hand , they can perceive each other , they can capture their movements , and they have a screen and a recei@@ ver sing@@ er . </s>
more importantly , they &apos;re physically physical , which is why you can only move them through the hands of the hands and access them . </s>
and the si@@ tat@@ ors are an example of a new generation of tools to manipu@@ late digital data . </s>
and when these tools become more physical and a awareness of their movements , to develop each other , identify each other , and see the intri@@ c@@ acy of our journey with them , then we can start to explore new and more enter@@ taining interaction ways . </s>
i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples . </s>
this si@@ z@@ able able for video is con@@ figu@@ ration , and when i ki@@ ck it in a direction , the video will be played forward , and if i played it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards . </s>
and these interactive portraits are true to each other . </s>
so when i put them on top of each other , that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested in . </s>
when they &apos;re surrounded by invite , they notice that they can get a little bit nervous . </s>
and they also feel their mo@@ tions and a@@ part@@ ments as well . </s>
so an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could apply everyday gest@@ ures to data , just like colors , like colors , how to do it with li@@ qui@@ ds . </s>
in this case , we &apos;ve con@@ fron@@ ted three si@@ zes as color po@@ ts , and i can use them to po@@ ur color in the middle where they &apos;re then mix@@ ed together . </s>
when we over@@ do it , we can protect a little bit back . </s>
there are also some nice opportunities in education such as languages , math or logic games , where we want to give people the possibility of fast error and want to see the results of the results right now . </s>
here i am -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i series that i make with a simple education program . </s>
this is a game with words that is a kind of mix@@ ture of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gles . </s>
basically , you get a round of si@@ zes on every single si@@ z@@ able letters , and while you &apos;re trying to make words , they &apos;re tested on a dictionary . </s>
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mix@@ ed again , and you &apos;ve got a new letter combination and a new way to try to test it . </s>
thank you . </s>
these are some kids who got on a trip to the media lab , and i could get them to try it out and take a video of it . </s>
they really loved it . </s>
one more interesting thing about these kinds of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instru@@ ction . </s>
all you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do . </s>
so here are a couple of people who test it . </s>
this is our yo@@ un@@ gest te@@ stam@@ ent t@@ one down there on the lower right . </s>
it turned out that he wanted to st@@ ack the si@@ de-@@ by-@@ side si@@ zes . </s>
so for him , they were just building blocks . </s>
this is an interactive anima@@ ting man@@ ner . </s>
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language lear@@ ners . </s>
that &apos;s fe@@ li@@ x . </s>
he can bring new characters into the scene by putting up the si@@ der from the table , showing this character . </s>
this is where he gets up the sun . </s>
the sun goes on . </s>
now , he &apos;s got a tra@@ ctor in the scene . </s>
the orange tra@@ ctor . </s>
good work ! yes ! </s>
by sha@@ king the si@@ t@@ ler and putting it next to each other , he can let the characters interact ... </s>
... his own story . </s>
hello ! </s>
it &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide how it evol@@ ves . </s>
flying cat . </s>
the last example that i have time for me to show you is a music sequen@@ cer sequence that we &apos;ve developed recently and we &apos;ve developed in the si@@ ev@@ es as a sound voice voice , b@@ ass and dru@@ ms . </s>
each has four different vari@@ ations ; you can sele@@ ct what you want to use . </s>
and you can put these sounds into the sequence , which you can put in any pattern that you can see . </s>
and you store them by simply holding a sound si@@ z@@ able to a sequence of sequence . </s>
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter . </s>
you put it with a certain sound , and then you en@@ code it . </s>
and then even ob@@ so@@ le@@ te effects such as speed and volume , which you apply to the whole sequence . </s>
so let &apos;s see . </s>
we &apos;re starting to in@@ corporate the leaders in two sequence of sequence , and put them in a row , expand it and add a little bit of the voice . </s>
now i add a b@@ ass . </s>
now , i &apos;m going to do something about it . </s>
and now i &apos;m bringing the fil@@ ters on the dru@@ ms so that i can control the effect of life . </s>
i can acceler@@ ate the whole sequence by car@@ d@@ board in one direction or another . </s>
and now i &apos;m connecting the fil@@ ters with the b@@ ass , for a little more expression . </s>
i can do the sequence as you walk away . </s>
so i don &apos;t have to plan them in the field , but i can impro@@ v@@ ise them ; they can impro@@ ve or s@@ lau@@ ghter . </s>
and finally , i can ex@@ tend the whole sequence by en@@ ab@@ ling the volume of the lou@@ dness in the left . </s>
thank you . </s>
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that fit better than our brains and bodies work . </s>
and today , i &apos;ve had time to show you a part of this new design world and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re working on in our lab . </s>
the idea that i want to leave you with is that we are on the ver@@ ge of this new generation of commer@@ ci@@ als to interact with digital media , bringing information to our world , which is our dem@@ ands . </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;m happy to talk to you all . </s>
well , good afternoon . </s>
i &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted that i &apos;m there . </s>
yeah , what &apos;s going to be bio@@ ha@@ cking ? </s>
i &apos;ve got to pick it up a little bit , and that &apos;s busy bio@@ ha@@ cking with modern molecular biology . </s>
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been working with the bio@@ ha@@ cking for a few years now , and that &apos;s what i started , because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do it most of all , what i learned , theore@@ tically , what i &apos;ve learned in college . </s>
so , that was my primary motivation . </s>
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get sort of closer to the matter , like this . </s>
so i think that molecular biology in general now , generally speaking , biotechn@@ ology , everything you want to do , synthetic biology and so on . </s>
extremely important , now , is extremely important and much , much more important in the future . </s>
there are contro@@ versi@@ al things like this whole gene@@ tically engine@@ ered plants on the ground . </s>
there &apos;s now craig vent@@ er in the u.s. a , who is trying to create bio@@ pro@@ spe@@ cts , which is gas@@ ol@@ ine . </s>
and then there are things that are totally arrived in the everyday world , which most people are not aware of , but for example , for example , for example , wash@@ ing enzy@@ mes that allow us to wash 4@@ 0-@@ degree degrees , are also gene@@ tically optimi@@ zed enzy@@ mes . </s>
and the list can continue to continue . </s>
and so , from the interest of this on this technology , i &apos;ve just continued to go further . </s>
so why now ha@@ ck ? </s>
most people know that this is from the software area . </s>
computers ha@@ ck , and then it will always be in the media , yes , the ha@@ ckers break somewhere and small data , and so on . </s>
it &apos;s kind of very sad for the ha@@ cker@@ y scene , because it doesn &apos;t matter what it &apos;s like , and what &apos;s actually going on behind it . </s>
and in fact , the software ha@@ irs , in the 197@@ 0s , in the &apos; 70s , started with computer boards , and that &apos;s the internet as well . </s>
and it &apos;s about solving with a play@@ ful , creative , original way of solving a problem . </s>
and problem , this is not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a way of simpli@@ fying what things simpli@@ fy , what things like simpli@@ stic proble@@ m-@@ solving , and how do you make that different or how do you do that better . </s>
and it &apos;s just been done with software , but there &apos;s also electronics in the electronics , there &apos;s also a whole road scene that &apos;s going on with electronics circu@@ its to make all kinds of tra@@ de-@@ off things . </s>
and now , also , in biology , and i want to take this metaphor that &apos;s coming from synthetic biology , that biology is really a information science , because , the d.@@ n@@ .@@ a code is an abstract code , which is yes , it &apos;s not very much like computers , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , so it &apos;s real matter , and not just cy@@ ber . </s>
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also code , and you can also ha@@ ck it up , like that , and that &apos;s what i find incredibly fascinating , and that &apos;s where i wanted to get a lot deeper . </s>
it actually took about two thousand eight eight really , really , these networks . </s>
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a dot@@ or@@ g , which is origin@@ ally from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , which is with europe , and with a cooperation in india in india , but now members or active people around the world now . </s>
so this is a more artistic ori@@ entation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosop@@ hers and philosop@@ hers and philosop@@ hi@@ es with scientists to just talk about these technologies and ask questions and do it crea@@ tively , because there &apos;s museum exhibi@@ tions and yes , all kinds of things . </s>
but it &apos;s actually all about trying to find a more sustainable access to that , such a play@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure . </s>
and then there &apos;s do@@ -@@ it-@@ bi@@ o dot dot@@ or@@ g , meaning i.@@ y@@ .@@ bi@@ o . </s>
this is from the u.s. a network , which is actually more like a for@@ um , where you meet and discus@@ sed and discus@@ sing online online . </s>
they &apos;re a little bit of a technical ori@@ entation and a little bit of business on the side , so there &apos;s some questions that are applied . </s>
and based on these networks that have made the whole popular , has developed a scene like a scene that i want to portraits for a second . </s>
here in the left-@@ hand side , you can see bio@@ fuel , which is a ha@@ cker@@ space , so basically a kind of school , private school , such a private school , non@@ profit facility , where everyone can come . </s>
kids , old , all kinds of people go there to just sit down , and they &apos;ve set up a lab lab , and they &apos;re looking at what these laboratory proto@@ col@@ s are doing . </s>
here is a group on the bottom left , a group in indones@@ ia , house fi@@ er@@ al fi@@ bers called the , but it &apos;s been quite a long time . </s>
even longer than these other two networks . </s>
they also get involved in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , electronics , and combine it in a very remote way . </s>
a group from ank@@ ara that i &apos;ve met a while ago , which is a student that &apos;s a student that would like to give the public group more like what they &apos;re learning in school , and they &apos;ve done so on on street small actions , and they &apos;ve tried to explain to people what d.@@ n@@ .@@ a is . </s>
and i have a lecture on the other side in cop@@ enhagen at cop@@ enhagen in the medical museum with an exhibition on the subject with an exhibition . </s>
and that is , yes , that &apos;s usually fairly young people , but the only thing that all united is common is this fascin@@ ation of technology . </s>
and what you can do with it , and just try to get into the society with it and say , okay , what do you know , what do you want to do , have your interest in bringing you this way ? </s>
so , who@@ -@@ k , in order to ha@@ ck biology , you need some kind of stuff . </s>
of course , you need biological materials , and you need tools as well , and that &apos;s a lab . </s>
or what you normally understand from a lab , which are sort of sort of w@@ re@@ t@@ ched machines , extremely expensive , extremely distant , just for profession@@ als , trained acade@@ mi@@ cs with ph.@@ d. ph@@ es and so on . </s>
and our approach was just to say , okay , that actually you don &apos;t have to do it . </s>
it &apos;s actually not necessary , because every single coffee machine has actually developed higher technology than most lab devices , which is really the same . </s>
and so with this pre@@ mis@@ e of this pre@@ mis@@ e of this pre@@ mis@@ e , for example , brian de@@ g@@ ger in england tried to assem@@ ble a minim@@ um ab@@ or , then took a minim@@ um of a ste@@ am prin@@ ter , a heat plate , and , yeah , it &apos;s so cru@@ de , and it &apos;s been bre@@ eding , working bacteria . </s>
so anyone who &apos;s che@@ cked a sou@@ p that he has left for too long , that he did for a long time . </s>
i tried this in my lab , i tried to ex@@ tend a little bit , and then i bought myself on e@@ bay equipment on e@@ bay and made a little bit of d.@@ n@@ .@@ c. a little bit , trying to make a fa@@ vor test , like this / n@@ .@@ a finger@@ print , again , to get home . </s>
it shouldn &apos;t be a joke , really , but . </s>
down here in the picture , you can see the lab , in execu@@ tion , so this is such a garage garage , with all sorts of lab sp@@ her@@ es that have been done , a group in paris that &apos;s been involved in that is pretty successful , and also doing quite interesting things , and i want to cut a project for a second . </s>
and this is bio@@ fuel , which just mentioned ha@@ cker@@ space , which is this kind of fol@@ k school in principle for molecular biology . </s>
and yeah , so you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene@@ ous , so there are people who are doing it home alone , so far to large organizations , larger organizations that are already doing it in institu@@ tion@@ alized form . </s>
but it &apos;s always always the idea that it &apos;s supposed to be easy and accessible . </s>
the first project we did as an international group , when we sort of became aware of our own ourselves , o@@ .@@ k. , there &apos;s now a real scene here , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people that are always ma@@ pping and so on . </s>
and then , from the do@@ -@@ it-@@ bi@@ o or@@ g or@@ g website , the fo@@ under website , we said , o@@ .@@ k , we have to really meet , also , real meetings , and then have two events organized , one in london , two thousand 10 , and short in the u.s. , san francisco , in san francisco . </s>
and so , there it was , yes , o@@ .@@ k , who are we , what do we want to do , what do we want to share ? </s>
and what are our values and what are our dest@@ in@@ ations , our foundation ? </s>
and what we did was we worked a co@@ p like this . </s>
so this was quite intuitive , so everybody just has his wi@@ sh@@ es , his wi@@ sh@@ es , his wi@@ sh@@ es , expres@@ sing him , then expres@@ sed . </s>
and there &apos;s a very good code , i think , in my opinion . </s>
and we don &apos;t have that one , but that &apos;s for sure , i think , i think , i &apos;ve gone quite well , the people are right there , the people are quite convinced . </s>
and we &apos;ve actually tried to bring it back into the academic world as well , but it &apos;s somehow not done that . </s>
so i think we &apos;re from the bio@@ ha@@ cking scene in terms of even one step further than the academic world . </s>
so , what kind of projects do we really want to do ? </s>
a project that i did with the ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land was that we wanted to tin@@ ker with something called a op@@ tical tra@@ b , or op@@ tic ch@@ al@@ k . </s>
this is when you focus a laser be@@ am on one in the room , then you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then move in that focus , so that &apos;s captured there , so it &apos;s like a tra@@ ctor be@@ ating in the principle of such a tra@@ ctor . </s>
this works really , this is done in academic terms , and we &apos;ve thought , okay , k , maybe we &apos;ll get a web@@ c@@ am , then we &apos;ve taken a web@@ c@@ am , that we put up the lens , the lens , you have a microscope , it &apos;s about four hundred times . </s>
this is what we &apos;re seeing down there . </s>
and then we broke down a d.@@ v@@ .@@ d burn , and the burning burning , and then tried to focus on that camera , and then tried to focus on this camera . </s>
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work out , but we still learned a lot about it . </s>
another project , from the french group here from paris , that worked out of paris , which is pretty cool . </s>
and in fact , he &apos;s got a kind of a brain wave device device , so e.@@ e.@@ g , or something like that , so he &apos;s concerned with neuro@@ biology , his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck . </s>
he then cli@@ cked this hel@@ met there , and in cooperation with the museum , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on . </s>
and then the vis@@ it@@ ors were able to go into the room , sit down on this chair , put this hel@@ met up . </s>
then their brain@@ waves were measured , and depending on what they thought they had , or as they thought , is then different lights in the room . </s>
so , it was a pretty good project . </s>
another thing from the united states , which also has to do with this father &apos;s story , is the p@@ .@@ c@@ .@@ r , which is the poly@@ mer chain reaction , complicated word . </s>
so it &apos;s about cop@@ ying genes , to multi@@ p@@ ly , which is re@@ stor@@ ing frag@@ ments , so you can make them visible . </s>
so now , when i do this , the pro@@ fil@@ es at the scene , then i go , collect some hair spec@@ im@@ ens , and then they do this technique , and then you can say , o@@ .@@ k. , this hair , this hair belon@@ gs to this person , like this . </s>
and the machines that do something like this are quite expensive , that you buy commer@@ cially , the che@@ ap@@ est , the che@@ ap@@ est go for four thousand euro@@ s . </s>
and that &apos;s not in the ho@@ b@@ by@@ area , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do very much . </s>
so this is just one use of many that you can do with it . </s>
and they &apos;ve done so two two ba@@ st@@ il@@ es , and say , o@@ .@@ k , that we make easier and cheaper , and then we have open source , so fre@@ ely available hardware , electronics , electrical things together , and now they &apos;ve brought it to the market and are now the che@@ ap@@ est ven@@ d@@ or of these devices around the world . </s>
i believe , in some ways , like six dollars or so on . </s>
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s certainly in a context where it &apos;s going to be clearly more available . </s>
so i think it &apos;s a very sad ha@@ ck ha@@ ck . </s>
and one project that i had recently started was building a gen@@ us gun . </s>
gen@@ e-@@ gun is , yeah , like a sort of air pressure gun , which is shooting about something like this , two centi@@ meters or something . </s>
you u@@ plo@@ ad that to gold particles and then the gold particles and the gold particles , and then i shot them up on oni@@ ons , and then i would light them up like this . </s>
so the device that you see there is not working . </s>
but this is my prototype , but it &apos;s pretty much looked down , like this , on a bran@@ ch of a bran@@ ch of electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure too , but the pressure was too high , that thing was broken . </s>
and then i took on a pen@@ cil and i put it in there . </s>
a pen@@ cil , if you make the full power with water , it has enough pressure , so i think , two to six to six , i think , six to six . </s>
and then you can acceler@@ ate the particles high enough , and then you go into the oni@@ on as well . </s>
and the commercial device costs about 50 thousand euro@@ s up , or something like that , by the way , by the 50 . </s>
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically fe@@ asi@@ ble . </s>
so this , at the moment , is also the core cause of raising the scene to increase this avail@@ ability of technology and also increase the information and the understanding that more people can engage in it . </s>
because , as i said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea about it , and also no way to really make it good . </s>
because when you read about it , when you read about it , it &apos;s not the same thing as if you &apos;ve done it yourself or saw it yourself . </s>
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies . </s>
and if you want to make meaningful decisions in society , you can make meaningful decisions in society , then you need to have access to knowledge and technology . </s>
and you have to do it and understand it , to make it and to understand it . </s>
and that &apos;s the company under the bat@@ ch and citi@@ zen science and citi@@ zen science . </s>
so just as citizens , you &apos;re able to put in the situation with these scientific technologies , right now . </s>
and that is the core cause of the bio@@ ha@@ ckers . </s>
these are the people who at least offi@@ cially embedded on the website , named i.@@ y@@ .@@ bio-@@ dot@@ -@@ or@@ g website . </s>
this is already a relatively substan@@ tial number of people around the world . </s>
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also represented in sou@@ the@@ ast asia . </s>
and that is , i think , these are fewer people who are fewer people than in fact . </s>
so i know some of you who haven &apos;t sat down . </s>
and these are just the bio@@ ha@@ ckers , the individual people . </s>
and part of that ha@@ cking space , too , so these places these places together . </s>
and that &apos;s quite the beginning . </s>
as i said , it &apos;s only started two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ ments . </s>
and ha@@ cking space , the computer ha@@ z@@ ards , because the c base in berlin was the first , nin@@ et@@ y-@@ hundreds of hundred . </s>
and this is now a gigan@@ tic network of very good , yes , infra@@ struc@@ tural centers that are represented all over the world . </s>
and we hope that , of course , that we &apos;re similar to similar , and then we &apos;re very well-@@ connected , and then very well connected , so that people can get more involved . </s>
and i would invite each one to engage with it and try it out again . </s>
it &apos;s not that simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible if you &apos;ve got enough curiosity and put enough energy into it , you &apos;re going to get there too far . </s>
thank you very much for listening . </s>
that &apos;s it . </s>
yes , hi . </s>
how do we make people work ? </s>
this is a question i &apos;m very excited about as a designer , but also in the area of research and research and all sorts of things in the field . </s>
it &apos;s about how to do people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and create a possible experience of satis@@ fying experience . </s>
i believe that the interactive media in our arch@@ a@@ ic media add@@ res@@ ses cognitive models , the paradigm that has been re@@ programm@@ ed in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can just bring back through interactive media . </s>
and this is very amazing , because actually you believe that this high-@@ tech technology that you &apos;ve en@@ counter@@ ed in the future , that it brings you into the future , but in fact , that the future is right for us , in our arch@@ a@@ ic roots , in our arch@@ a@@ ic roots . </s>
so what are arch@@ a@@ ic models now ? </s>
i &apos;ve written up four words once , and i &apos;d like to explain that a little bit . </s>
arch@@ a@@ ic cognitive models , which are the models that we used to do in the pre-@@ industrial times . </s>
for these arch@@ a@@ ic models , we heard that we have basically a natural relationship to virtu@@ ality . </s>
now that sounds unusual first . </s>
but i &apos;m going to go back to that in a second and try and prove that you have a natural relationship to virtu@@ ality . </s>
the second thing is that since this arch@@ a@@ ic model , we &apos;ve been able to speak very , very visual , even though we &apos;re now using a co@@ di@@ fied language today . </s>
and the third area , actually , is explaining by itself . </s>
we all know that the interactive media by definition is non@@ linear , which includes the reason of lin@@ ear@@ ity , and of course what we &apos;re told of course is that we feel the lin@@ ear@@ ity as normal . </s>
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information . </s>
how now is this with the virtu@@ ality that is actually the most natural thing in the world . </s>
i want to prove that to you . </s>
how many doors does the house have in which they live ? </s>
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but this is going to happen , and this is what happens at the moment . </s>
they go through this house through this house , in which they live , and look at how many doors there are . </s>
and that &apos;s exactly what they do . </s>
it virtu@@ es the reality without computers . </s>
fantastic , right ? </s>
and there &apos;s , for example , at the medi@@ an campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v@@ .@@ r. lab , we can actually do that all the time . </s>
and that wealth of the virtual reality to virtu@@ e the reality that people have needed in the pre-@@ industrial times , because they didn &apos;t have anything . </s>
they didn &apos;t have books . </s>
or they didn &apos;t have a photo@@ shop . </s>
they didn &apos;t have mass media . </s>
the only thing they had was their head . </s>
and in that head , the memory was playing . </s>
in this mind , knowledge was called , and with these virtual images , the imagination , were just passed on . </s>
and so it &apos;s also so strong to us that we can deal with virtu@@ ality so well . </s>
what &apos;s interesting about this is , if i can make a little trip away . </s>
yes , it can do it . </s>
the interesting thing about this is that at this time , man was equally media produ@@ cer and medium itself . </s>
now you &apos;re thinking about a little bit more . </s>
what are media today ? </s>
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been a change . </s>
but that &apos;s what i &apos;ll be talking about again . </s>
fundamental tools of information interface have been stories since all the time . </s>
sha@@ do@@ ws , prie@@ sts , the so-called knowledge wat@@ ers , were addi@@ cted to keep knowledge in stories . </s>
and even today , we &apos;re getting very , very strong in stories . </s>
and the author of the story of the story of the story of the story of the book , jonathan got@@ ch@@ a : we still have a hundred hours a hundred hours to re@@ generate the re@@ cep@@ tor of stories . </s>
this means for a child who has spent most of his life spent most of his life with the reci@@ pro@@ tion of stories . </s>
now we think our love of stories depends on killing us as a child on the la@@ p of our parents . </s>
no , no , really missing . </s>
this goes back a lot further into the cultures of pre-@@ industrial times . </s>
but for me , in the realm of interactive media , the most impres@@ sive is that we &apos;ve brought in our biological memory , the ability to think non@@ linear , the ability to think about non@@ linear . </s>
i gave you an example of the north american tri@@ be of no@@ ot@@ ka@@ -@@ native native . </s>
and life lived in the co@@ ast@@ al area of british colum@@ bia . </s>
and as you can see , this is a very island area , and you had to sort of navi@@ gate there , from island to island , to raise food . </s>
and they &apos;ve done that with something called le@@ ad@@ -@@ land maps . </s>
you may know this , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in the austr@@ ali@@ an im@@ migr@@ ants . </s>
they have similar principles . </s>
they don &apos;t have any le@@ an land@@ cards , but they have such gen@@ ic son@@ o@@ ines or trau@@ ma fa@@ des . </s>
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navi@@ gation and the topo@@ graphy of regions could be ma@@ pped across songs of songs . </s>
when the language was sub@@ mer@@ ged by the sub@@ mer@@ sible ran@@ ged ran@@ g . </s>
that is , you navi@@ gate with sound and about rhyth@@ m . </s>
and these sounds and this rhyth@@ m have shown the ge@@ ology , the topo@@ graphy of an area , and that has also allowed you to de@@ construct these songs and put them together differently and put them right back to the left and move back to the right place . </s>
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from above a to b ? </s>
anyway , to navi@@ gate . </s>
now , what has happened ? </s>
this is what happened to be the gen@@ ic machine age . </s>
we &apos;ve moved into something called the bird age age . </s>
so , the machine is the machine age , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s photo@@ animation . </s>
and that &apos;s exactly what happened , that we have the responsibility for our memories and the production of our individual memories of our individual memories of ex@@ ternal media . </s>
on the book , and into the picture . </s>
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god lost god lost . </s>
virtu@@ ality has suddenly become alien to us , and has nothing to do with the reality of reality . </s>
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at bri@@ gh@@ ton university , has gone so far to say that this mass media , he says the book and the picture , so not the television , the internet and so on , what we call mass media today , that this mass media of our memories has fossi@@ li@@ zed , and our ability to virtu@@ e our ability to virtu@@ e . </s>
so let &apos;s make a little inter@@ faces . </s>
from the avi@@ an age to the machine age . </s>
what has determin@@ es to our minds on our minds and on our memory ? </s>
and then the fa@@ i@@ ths of the pre-@@ industrial cultures are pre-@@ industrial . </s>
and they &apos;re more and more , over the course of centuries , and more and more over@@ written by the influ@@ ences of the machine . </s>
that is , instead of remember@@ ing us individu@@ ally , we &apos;ve been standar@@ di@@ zed , wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad , wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad patterns of memories that we can hang out of our personal memories . </s>
we produce no longer ourselves . </s>
we have an abstract kind of an abstract language . </s>
we don &apos;t think of the thing anymore in terms of things that aren &apos;t in pictures anymore , but we can cook them with our language . </s>
we &apos;ve been used to that things are happening linear . </s>
and we &apos;ve accep@@ ted the lin@@ ear@@ ity as a law , and there are only ex@@ ceptions , like the non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity . </s>
what rema@@ ined us is saying the story . </s>
we still have been very , very , very ar@@ re@@ sted as a information tool . </s>
the question is , what &apos;s next ? </s>
we had the vo@@ w age , we had the machine age , and we called this &quot; cyber@@ age age . &quot; </s>
it sounds very sil@@ ly , and it sounds very much like science fiction , i know . </s>
but these concepts of cyber@@ age , who bring us these opportunities back back to our cap@@ abilities . </s>
this is about virtu@@ ality , it &apos;s about non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , it &apos;s about argu@@ ing . </s>
i want to explain this for a second . </s>
there are technical concepts such as aug@@ mented reality , which is the aug@@ mented reality . </s>
so if you look at google sear@@ ches , for example , this is a concept that makes us combine the virtual world with the real world , which is our aff@@ ir@@ mation of virtu@@ e , which is virtual than something normal , natural , natural , is being add@@ ressed again . </s>
another example is what we call the virtual reality . </s>
so crazy in the context of my talk , of course , in the context of my talk , we &apos;re moving physically into non-@@ existing , virtual worlds , just after the model of the h@@ olo@@ c@@ ene . </s>
and other examples are the ambi@@ tious , intelligent systems . </s>
these are rooms that can be respond to intelligent beings . </s>
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real habitat . </s>
i gradu@@ ated , and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the b@@ ach@@ el@@ ary work of michael bur@@ k , an@@ na ka@@ thr@@ in cr@@ ence , jor@@ is z@@ break and jan@@ -@@ mor@@ it@@ z trash er . </s>
and the two last , too , are here today . </s>
maybe you can stand up for a second , so you can enter@@ tain the two to talk about this . </s>
and this project , i brought together , as an example , how back to this arch@@ a@@ ic model is add@@ res@@ sing cognitive models . </s>
all of this is a game , i have to say that . </s>
and what happens , of course , which is very important , of course , and it &apos;s a computer game . </s>
and when i say computer game , you &apos;re very likely to see that any person in front of any con@@ sol@@ ation of any con@@ sol@@ ation or that you play with any con@@ so@@ le con@@ so@@ le . </s>
anyway , they &apos;re doing it in anyway . </s>
this is a game for outside . </s>
and that is deci@@ ding that i explor@@ ed the outside world , so i discover the real world again . </s>
and this game conne@@ cts the virtual world , so the data on the data space that we produce with the real world . </s>
i apo@@ logi@@ ze that i have to go down so much . </s>
you can explain that much better , there &apos;s a lot more to it . </s>
and this is because i discover a city by looking at which places have been positive or negative or negative . </s>
and so i hold from the city a very different view , a very different impres@@ sion , which is that i see negative and positive z@@ ones in a city and i have a very different virtual map of this sort of virtual map of a very real city . </s>
and we can look at that now . </s>
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing in the same way . </s>
of course , this virtual world in the walls of our cities is clear . </s>
and with a kind of a flash@@ light , we can see these virtual worlds . </s>
so , i would like to sum@@ mar@@ ize that my talk in the sense that the properties and the skill that we have acqui@@ red out of the vo@@ cal age of the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary age , which is a bit of a bit in the machine age that can be activ@@ ated with cy@@ ber age , and that we can be activ@@ ated in this way of complex , technological products , and that in this way we don &apos;t actually get into the future , but to come back to our roots . </s>
thank you . </s>
yeah , i &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to be allowed to you . </s>
i &apos;ve just been asked if this s@@ ack is a s@@ ack s@@ ack , and i &apos;m going to talk instead of my talk . </s>
he won &apos;t do that . </s>
i &apos;ll also open up what it is in there . </s>
but so far , i &apos;m going to do it a little bit curious . </s>
yes , kids are curious about nature , or should be curious , designers . </s>
i &apos;m a gest@@ ure of house , so i &apos;m also involved with the issue of curiosity and how the curiosity changes our thinking , and why do we lose curiosity and we need to re@@ cover it and so on and so forth . </s>
that &apos;s a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with in front of your actual existence as a function . </s>
when profess@@ ors are getting curious , they &apos;re often po@@ pped into this kind of research se@@ me@@ ster . </s>
and that &apos;s also what i &apos;ve been having in the last half years . </s>
so , a research on the subject of natural user interface . </s>
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why do the cre@@ ators begin to engage with such natural , arch@@ a@@ ic ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zation of communication , interaction and so forth . </s>
and that &apos;s where i just hold one of these little devices , because things are meant to be more intuitive , more and more natural , user friendly , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually human beings , of course , which is , of course , user or intui@@ tively . </s>
and before that background , i &apos;ve been in the field of natural user design design , so the next generation of human computing , i think , is working in the relationship of the human computer , how our tools or how the computer computers changes from the computer su@@ mm@@ ed to the digital assi@@ stant . </s>
so i was strug@@ gling with this , when , of course , or intui@@ tively . </s>
you might have to look again at this again . </s>
why does this even happen ? </s>
so if we look at the evolution of our society , a little bit briefly , we move from the third to the fourth society generation or society . </s>
so from modern society , from modern society . </s>
every society is shaped by a primary medium . </s>
at the beginning , the tri@@ b@@ al society begins with the language . </s>
that is , you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve spoken a common language , you could communicate with each other , moved into the same cave or in other areas , form or villages or villages , and have created such a tri@@ b@@ al , tri@@ b@@ al society . </s>
but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , a very natural thing . </s>
you had to learn , therefore , not a small child can speak of nature , but we &apos;re learning su@@ c@@ essi@@ ve and propor@@ tion . </s>
that was trig@@ ger@@ ed by the ancient society and the first form of abstra@@ ction . </s>
and this was a huge out@@ cry at the time , because of course the living language started to mani@@ fest itself in the form of writing , which is what fluid and alive is , i &apos;m going to start and manipu@@ late it in stone , and i &apos;m also mani@@ pul@@ ating it . </s>
depending on the way i cover and when i suspe@@ ct , of course , there &apos;s a whole different co@@ verage , of course , than when there &apos;s a life of life . </s>
but then su@@ k@@ z@@ essi@@ ve was taking this film as a primary medium , as a primary medium . </s>
then the next generation that we actually actually live in today is pri@@ mar@@ ily living . </s>
this is just through pressure and print with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others . </s>
at the time , it was like a monkey ron@@ t , where a@@ del , kl@@ er@@ us and others have said , are you crazy when the people start reading , then the afterwards wants to talk , and that &apos;s completely fat@@ al . </s>
and now we &apos;re coming into the next generation , and the exciting thing is , this gener@@ ating shift is only every few hundred years , and we &apos;re really really in this phenomen@@ al phase , that we &apos;re doing something like this . </s>
this conf@@ used us , of course , because we &apos;re seeing on the one side of the new media , social social media , facebook us@@ o@@ w and so on . </s>
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what makes the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the las@@ er horse meat and no bee@@ f is more or other phenomen@@ a , i want to cover it just , and i want to do it at all . </s>
and these two worlds just cra@@ ck up each other , new and old thinking . </s>
the exciting thing about this is when you look at it , this new society , this computer society , is de@@ ple@@ ted to very many mechanis@@ ms , principles and arch@@ a@@ ic thinking patterns from the tri@@ b@@ al society . </s>
now no longer at the local level , but at the global level . </s>
we understood that the weather is global . </s>
that the issue of ec@@ ology is a global one . </s>
not when i think of lo@@ cally ecolo@@ gi@@ cally , and the neighbor is less ecolo@@ gi@@ cally , it doesn &apos;t work anymore . </s>
that is , from the local village , a global village has actually become a global village with the same principles , of course , possibly intui@@ tively , but also total transparency . </s>
just as you knew in the village , who has something to do with whom and when , now , this is happening today about this exten@@ sion of our self through these mobile devices at the global level . </s>
be that we know that we know global accu@@ mu@@ lation and ag@@ gre@@ gate faster and better . </s>
just like it used to be in the village in the village . </s>
before the background , i &apos;ve just been busy looking at what &apos;s called , because of course , what &apos;s natural for us , of course , is what we might have lost , which is instin@@ ctively , but what makes us instin@@ ctively , so what makes a difference ? </s>
because often people get people , they can &apos;t use it kin@@ dly so that anybody can deal with it . </s>
so you have to deal with it , which is that , and not only do it change that it &apos;s different , but it should be better . </s>
and when , of course , is a little bit intuitive , and how can i take influence as a form of influence , and just make things like that , you know , they &apos;re a user friendly , so they &apos;re possible , because they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re easy to use . </s>
you go around , even during the study , with the issue of perception and per@@ ceptions . </s>
and that , of course , is where you start and look and say , okay , now i &apos;m just going to go into the inner self . </s>
and what is it going to look like in there ? </s>
so how do we work when we go down there ? </s>
and what is in fact , of course , intui@@ tively , and how do we create our chan@@ ces of perception and how does it work cognitive processing ? </s>
because steve jobs once said , you know , you &apos;re running to talk to you to share to talk to it . </s>
so you really have to look in detail , if i want to make some use of user friendly or intui@@ tively , what does that mean in the core ? </s>
and then you can see that a seven of our seven senses , most of us think that we &apos;ve only been five , is even seven , because certainly in the near future , there &apos;s another sense of sense , and as an exten@@ sion , and as an exten@@ sion of our own selves . </s>
and watch , how do we process information , how do we take information on it ? </s>
by the way , what &apos;s information ? </s>
information is a difference that makes a difference . </s>
a lot of the word , however , doesn &apos;t know what it is that means detail . </s>
but i have to understand , in the core of understanding when information is going to information , when data becomes information , and knowing information , so that i know how to intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively , or , of course , make access . </s>
and of course , design affec@@ ts the perception of perception . </s>
we see this when i design things , i can conf@@ use them like the right side of the right , where i don &apos;t know , what &apos;s salt and pe@@ pper , or i can make it intui@@ tively intuitive by showing things . </s>
so , much more natural , it &apos;s in a po@@ ison , but i &apos;m sort of looking straight , where is salt and pe@@ pper in there . </s>
and if i tell you , give me some salt or pe@@ pper , then it &apos;ll be on the right for the first time , where &apos;s in there . </s>
and in the left hand just intuitive , and then i hope that no sugar is in there , that salt can just give up . </s>
but also our perception of self , how do you dec@@ ei@@ ve us ? </s>
for example , that perception in the context . </s>
the right circle looks larger than the small , even though it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s just the same size , and yet our perception changes depending on what context we &apos;re putting in . </s>
does anybody know what this is ? </s>
come on . </s>
you should still work . </s>
that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses . </s>
so it &apos;s a circle . </s>
a second circle starts to cor@@ relate or cor@@ relate or associ@@ ate or associ@@ ate . </s>
and if i then take a hal@@ v@@ age , we look at a hal@@ ve unit , we don &apos;t just see one unit , which is circle and circle and , but we see one unit , we don &apos;t see three pieces , a circle , a circle , one another . </s>
this is called gest@@ ure law , or gest@@ ure psychology , which also influ@@ enced us in perception . </s>
for the designers , which are usually the first se@@ me@@ ster in the first se@@ me@@ ster , the amazing laws . </s>
gest@@ ure laws of the continu@@ ous law of continu@@ ity and so on . </s>
so , often in the third , the third forget . </s>
but that &apos;s a cru@@ cial component , if you just want to make things intui@@ tively intuitive . </s>
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is vision . </s>
first of all , ban@@ al , but it &apos;s very exciting if you think about it . </s>
so we have the eyes in front , and now , you know , we &apos;re looking backwards , we &apos;re looking back . </s>
that &apos;s wrong . </s>
so , you know , they &apos;re looking forward from the back . </s>
and then they pro@@ posed a assu@@ mption forward to see that they see something that they recognize , unique circle , un@@ prece@@ d@@ ented circle . </s>
that is , we proje@@ cted first before we see it , before we see it , bringing it back into our se@@ ctors to say , okay . </s>
i got this sort of cognitive feedback , you did something you want to see , which you want to see . </s>
so that &apos;s there , then , that &apos;s coming back . </s>
and then it goes back to the front , because it doesn &apos;t do it in the back of the day and say , now , look , now , again , what you see , what you see , what you see , this is what you want to see . </s>
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually seen . </s>
so a very , very exciting process , how certain things are going on , and what kind of milli@@ mi@@ cs do these things are happening . </s>
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture of . </s>
that &apos;s the same thing that i described to you about earlier . </s>
now , everyone is trying to see something from this pattern . </s>
i don &apos;t know who recogni@@ zes what . </s>
does anybody see anything particular ? </s>
a d@@ al@@ mati@@ an ink , exactly . </s>
once i saw that , there &apos;s a d@@ al@@ ma@@ ker in there , you know ? </s>
you &apos;ll never forget it , because i &apos;m going to show you where the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er is . </s>
now you can see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er . </s>
and on , now you &apos;re always looking at it . </s>
that is , i &apos;ve actually de@@ alt with them now that they don &apos;t recognize any patterns , but i &apos;ve condi@@ tioned it within a very short amount of time , seeing this dog in this mu@@ til@@ ated picture . </s>
and this is the proje@@ ction of vision , feedback , vision . </s>
now i know it , and now i &apos;m proje@@ cting that i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er looking forward . </s>
i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er . </s>
so really , very exciting processes , which then in this , yes , gray processes , they &apos;re actually not , but here in this ro@@ cky mass , it &apos;s just going to happen . </s>
does anybody know what &apos;s three seconds ? </s>
long , yeah . </s>
that &apos;s our present . </s>
well , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer as a designer . </s>
if i know something takes three seconds to go from the present loop to the present loop , i can also bridge it very well , in which i can always do it by someone with three seconds and three seconds . </s>
that &apos;s what he has to do as a present present . </s>
and then it moves into the past , and so i can bridge very elegant times for example on the computer when i know this phenomenon . </s>
what is it about five milli@@ seconds of milli@@ seconds ? </s>
yeah , milli@@ seconds . </s>
also , a very interesting phenomenon . </s>
that &apos;s the period in which you fall . </s>
that means that if you know this now , pay attention to who you &apos;re looking at as long , because i &apos;m not taking a gun , which is what &apos;s going to happen to happen . </s>
and six@@ teen milli@@ seconds , also a very interesting phenomenon . </s>
that is the period of most of the per@@ ceptions that we have . </s>
that is , the first impres@@ sive impres@@ sion is in a quick speed , fast speed of how we perceive things . </s>
and as we see things in what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re sort of rel@@ ying on our environment so we can think of it as well . </s>
of course , designers don &apos;t only deal with the issue of per@@ mission and neural processing or cognitive processing or cognitive , of course , with the issue of human@@ -@@ object relations . </s>
so how do you go with some things with certain things . </s>
there &apos;s a product of practical functions that have practical functions , so for@@ mal aspects or for@@ mal@@ aes@@ thetic aspects . </s>
there are tracking functions where i know exactly where i have to reach . </s>
but there are also symbo@@ lic functions , why is someone like this a little bit of work for a little bit , where hardly what fits , so hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous su@@ ms of money , even though it &apos;s not that conveni@@ ent ? </s>
we &apos;re more likely to be symbo@@ lic , based on the significant level that we &apos;re looking at as designers . </s>
back to my actual theme of natural user interface and the issue , which is natural , of course , is us@@ eless . </s>
us@@ ability always means how to achieve a certain amount of goal , or how to reach a users in a particular context , effective and satis@@ fying and satis@@ fying satis@@ fac@@ tion . </s>
so it says , you know , it &apos;s the nor@@ m . </s>
how can i make something possible friendly ? </s>
if i can use that right or maybe i need the man@@ ual , i need some exc@@ it@@ ement training for it . </s>
and less us@@ able , or user friendly , is it . </s>
that i do it only differently and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able . </s>
you also have to understand that . </s>
and then when you have the software that we &apos;ve just seen , looking at it , you &apos;re also going to understand why nine percent of our software today is just a little bit intuitive , or not us@@ able , the i-@@ pad in many areas or i-@@ phones , although it &apos;s much more intuitive than classic software . </s>
and in fact , intuitive user is not just a fundamental economy since apple , the more fundamental success factor , if i want to har@@ ness people &apos;s technological devices . </s>
why ? </s>
because when we usually rule through this new kind of us@@ ability , the natural user faces , for example , five times faster on our dest@@ ination , are five times faster . </s>
you have to imagine that if you do something of the classic so@@ le so@@ f@@ l , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , only one hour of natural software . </s>
it doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours more , but your emplo@@ yer or any other person can get them working with them for the four hours . </s>
but i want to say , of course , that it &apos;s an exc@@ it@@ ement capacity for us to do things as well . </s>
if we give ourselves back to the realm of the software , here the first comm@@ and line inter@@ faces were very abstract where you needed months to deal with these systems . </s>
and then the next , which already came with &quot; ne@@ me neural model or mental model like the software e@@ er@@ gon@@ ia , &quot; which is , you know , you would have an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top to make the computer us@@ able . </s>
so no longer zer@@ os and ones or cr@@ yp@@ tic codes , but just a metaphor . </s>
now , that &apos;s been much more us@@ er-@@ friendly , but it &apos;s also much better , of course . </s>
the next generation of graphi@@ cal inter@@ faces is working much more with behavior . </s>
so as a result , i find a lot more likely to behave than that . </s>
it &apos;s also a paradigm shift . </s>
that i suddenly look that this is always more important for success , and the us@@ h is going to be an app . </s>
and if i go one step further into these natural user inter@@ faces , where i am in voice , by language , by touch , by touch , by gest@@ ures , by gest@@ ures , no more by mouse and cur@@ sor , i have to control things , i think i &apos;m faster and more immedi@@ ate . </s>
but that brings me back to the point , when are things going to get more intuitive ? </s>
when you get more intuitive , and then i have to take my little friend here and see my little friend here , and what does that mean for a view of cognitive view , when is it really something that &apos;s really intuitive ? </s>
and that , for us , is always a little bit intuitive for us if i don &apos;t have to think about it very much . </s>
so he doesn &apos;t like to think about it , but it &apos;s easy to do it . </s>
so the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is . </s>
and what does that mean for the designers ? </s>
that is , when we look at that we can trans@@ mit existing action models from one another to something else , like the metaphor , then i can make it as old as designers . </s>
that is , i can just put an intuitive human model into a software model to a software model to make the software a much more use . </s>
imagine the question , of course , which is actually the most intuitive hand sche@@ matic hand of us humans , and now i &apos;m going to tell you . </s>
this is the so-called o@@ si@@ t model . </s>
this uses each of us , and o@@ ops , an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m and stands for ori@@ entation , selec@@ tive , in@@ formed , trans@@ mission . </s>
it makes all of you all the time , but it makes it un@@ conscious and sort of intuitive , or par@@ tly instin@@ ctively . </s>
the model is already bu@@ ll@@ ed into the wom@@ b , and is inter@@ cultural , so it works around the world at young and old , and it &apos;s being used all the time , without most of us know that this model is there . </s>
o@@ dor@@ o@@ ties are going to be about 50 to 17 thousand times each of us ever to activity , so you can see that it &apos;s actually less common@@ ly par@@ ked than a day . </s>
so i can just ori@@ ent to this mental control model , selec@@ tively in@@ form , trans@@ mission trans@@ mission into an interaction system . </s>
and through this kind of trans@@ mission , sort of like the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top , but not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a hand@@ -@@ pattern pattern , a hand@@ ling principle . </s>
and this is on a higher gra@@ il of user kin@@ dness than the trans@@ mission of a classic metaphor , which is the des@@ k@@ top of the des@@ k@@ top . </s>
and when i think of this , for example , for example , in the ori@@ entation of what i &apos;m looking at , selec@@ tively , selec@@ ting as a choice , in@@ formed in the event , it &apos;s big to me , i can look at it in detail , and yes , i can tran@@ sc@@ end it , i can send it somewhere or send someone or buy it and so on . </s>
and then i can trans@@ mit the whole thing . </s>
i &apos;m going to try this through an example . </s>
now , everybody &apos;s already e@@ aten ca@@ ke . </s>
over@@ view : now i &apos;m sort of interacting with the object , and i can zoom out , and i can zoom in . </s>
i &apos;ll get all the time over@@ view , can now filter this up and say , show me all the things with chocolate . </s>
and suddenly an interface , which is much more intuitive and much more natural . </s>
because , i can grab things like the bits , and i can touch them , and they come to me , and they &apos;re much more natural than hierarch@@ ically organized web pages or other mechanis@@ ms to make these things accessible . </s>
imagination is more spee@@ ding , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to close with this phrase , a and again , designers , and designers have to think differently about new solutions to new solutions , and in this sense i thank you very much for your attention and please . </s>
i want to help you with a very specific aspect of curiosity . </s>
the first is , when you get big as a child , as a baby , is you care about what di@@ vor@@ ce you have , yes ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less or less in the po@@ ckets , the more the curiosity , of course , will tissue your curiosity . </s>
and curiosity does not learn . </s>
that &apos;s why anybody who &apos;s here and curious , in fact , are people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn . </s>
i &apos;m now about , basically , this whole environmental discussion , worl@@ d-@@ class , four@@ teen years , clu@@ bs of clu@@ bs of clu@@ bs in the room . </s>
and there &apos;s a central point to this . </s>
and that depends on phosphor@@ us . </s>
give pe@@ e a chance . </s>
every day they give + they give you scale about two gra@@ ms of phosphor@@ us , and every day you have to pick up two gra@@ ms of phosphor@@ us . </s>
otherwise , they can &apos;t have teeth . </s>
you can &apos;t store energy . </s>
you can &apos;t have a bone . </s>
we could only be able to am@@ pli@@ fy m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ alities through the world ocean . </s>
if we actually don &apos;t take any phosphor@@ us and for@@ give . </s>
amazing , it &apos;s so amazing that we &apos;re dealing with something which is actually self-@@ understanding , but it &apos;s not that much . </s>
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but no one &apos;s talking about the phosphor@@ us problem . </s>
the phosphor@@ us problem is much more critical . </s>
we depend on two countries . </s>
we only have phosphor@@ us phosphor@@ us for two years , and now through the phosphor@@ us mining mining worldwide , we put a lot more ur@@ ani@@ um into the environment than in all nuclear facili@@ ties . </s>
just in the last 20 years , five thousand tons of ur@@ ani@@ um had been distributed to our fields in germany . </s>
and we &apos;re going to take all that up . </s>
it makes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in children . </s>
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harm@@ ful . </s>
so , for example , sh@@ y the environment , drive less car . </s>
sh@@ y the environment , make less waste . </s>
sh@@ y the environment , use less energy . </s>
but that &apos;s not a protection . </s>
this is , as if i said , shake your kid , it &apos;ll only do three times more than five times . </s>
this is just a little bit less destruction . </s>
if we think from the wei@@ ghts from the ba@@ th@@ room to the ba@@ th@@ room , our whole earth is going to be a ce@@ o or a ce@@ o . </s>
that &apos;s why wei@@ gh the wei@@ ghts of wei@@ ght@@ le@@ ment . </s>
and the most important thing is to look at the soil as well as the first . </s>
in the bottom , over 60 percent of the carbon is saved . </s>
at the moment , we &apos;re building corn and losing between 11 and three kilogra@@ ms of tons per he@@ ct@@ are per he@@ ct@@ are or on the square meter . </s>
that is , we lose about five times more than we do in the ground . </s>
of course , we can look at the waste problem first . </s>
and everything is pack@@ aging or content . </s>
in openness , for example , the house@@ hold is 20 percent of the waste of the garbage by now . </s>
and as we get older , the wind gets larger . </s>
these are all in the front of the rec@@ tan@@ gle . </s>
yes ? </s>
a baby needs about six@@ th an@@ x@@ iety wind . </s>
of course , we could reduce that by about 10 percent , but what does that do ? </s>
this is balan@@ ced in china in a second . </s>
this is completely trivi@@ al . </s>
so the question is , how do we deal with these wind things ? </s>
here &apos;s one of the reasons here , by the way , that men are not pig@@ s . </s>
let me tell you . </s>
because the phosphor@@ us is em@@ it@@ ted to the pig@@ s for the strong parts of the parts . </s>
people are talking about the ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zation . </s>
yeah . </s>
so men can &apos;t be pig@@ s . </s>
because this is what &apos;s happened to it , isn &apos;t it ? </s>
tradition@@ ally we think in environmental terms , we &apos;re too many in the world . </s>
and if you de@@ grade the people that exist when you say it , if you say that &apos;s better , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be more sophisticated and ho@@ sti@@ le . </s>
and so somebody like al gore , one of our great heroes , is nothing more important than stabili@@ zing the human population . </s>
in israel , they say , if you rescu@@ ed a human life , you rescu@@ e the earth . </s>
this is , the more you go around , the better . </s>
yeah . </s>
the first question is , are we really too many ? </s>
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants wei@@ gh about four times more than we humans . </s>
i could take off ter@@ mit@@ es , but in the united states no one ter@@ mit@@ es like that , even though they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ ari@@ ans . </s>
that is , the ants wei@@ gh much more than us . </s>
and because they work much harder than we , and because they live only three or six months , they dis@@ agree with their weight , in the energy consumption , some 30 billion people . </s>
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ? </s>
and where you see how far we &apos;re away from what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , that we &apos;re at all on earth at all , you can see that we can see a program that has a program , for example , about 20 to 40 , you want to be climate neu@@ tral , right ? </s>
they can only be carb@@ on-@@ neu@@ tral if they don &apos;t exist , right ? </s>
the only chance . </s>
have you ever seen a cli@@ man@@ eu@@ an tree ? </s>
yes ? </s>
one ? </s>
that means our whole intelligence is that we want to be dum@@ b as trees as trees , right ? </s>
yes ? </s>
no tree is carbon neu@@ tral . </s>
lu@@ ck@@ ily , yes , yes ? </s>
there is no over@@ population problem in trees . </s>
there are still six billion trees alone in the amazon alone . </s>
you &apos;ve heard some of the over@@ population problems of trees before ? </s>
that is , all of our intelligence is that we want to be du@@ mp@@ ed as trees . </s>
and when you see , even in something like de@@ meter , the most stri@@ king bio@@ agriculture -- agriculture doesn &apos;t allow our own metaboli@@ c products to go back . </s>
every year we lose three million tons of phosphor@@ us that really would have to go back to cir@@ cular . </s>
and we &apos;re too many of them . </s>
alone . </s>
that is , we feel so guil@@ ty about the earth that we &apos;re saying , there is no bio@@ degra@@ dation , no organic , no , no natural pro@@ gr@@ ess@@ man and how they are hot , and how they allow our own ex@@ pos@@ ure to our own ex@@ pos@@ ure . </s>
isn &apos;t that sad ? </s>
that &apos;s too much . </s>
it &apos;s sure to be less harm@@ ful for being less harm@@ ful about oil consumption . </s>
but where are we useful ? </s>
we &apos;re trying to mini@@ mi@@ ze our ecolo@@ gical footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that &apos;s useful . </s>
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the highest , isn &apos;t there , yes ? </s>
nu@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ sions , yes ? </s>
you can only have nu@@ c@@ le@@ mis@@ sions , if you &apos;re not there . </s>
even if they were shooting now , they would have emissions . </s>
so you can &apos;t solve this at all . </s>
we can do it differently . </s>
we can re@@ gain our nutri@@ ents . </s>
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil where we &apos;re going back to the nutri@@ ents . </s>
directly , we can get back to this kind of nutri@@ ent nutri@@ tional nutri@@ ents . </s>
we do this in china , for example , where we take the waste from it . </s>
in china , they &apos;re still going to be a honey killing honey today , so they &apos;re like , yes ? </s>
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to bring our nutri@@ ents back . </s>
that means the whole western civili@@ za@@ tion-@@ story is that the city has always taken away , but the farmers never did anything back . </s>
and so the cities had to grow more and more because the farmers went into the cities and the cities had to bring their nutri@@ ents away their nutri@@ ents . </s>
all the western rich are always expanding until they don &apos;t get the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re im@@ plo@@ aded . </s>
yes ? </s>
in china , it was different . </s>
you &apos;ve done fra@@ c@@ tious civilization for over five years , because you &apos;ve always been able to bring back the nutri@@ ents . </s>
even today , if you &apos;re invited to dinner in china , you &apos;re expected to stay long until you pick up the toilet . </s>
because it &apos;s un@@ friendly to walk and bring nutri@@ ents to the nutri@@ ents . </s>
you &apos;ve been invited to eat them , not for nutri@@ ent the@@ ft . </s>
that means you can see on the internet , how to re@@ gain the nutri@@ ents . </s>
what &apos;s really nice about this is , if you do that , agriculture , bi@@ og@@ as created on a he@@ ct@@ are of a he@@ ct@@ are of five people in fa@@ vel@@ as , it can grow a farmer of about a hundred dollars in fa@@ vel@@ as and waiting for it to grow chi@@ ck@@ ens and pig@@ s and pig@@ s and vege@@ tables and fish and fish . </s>
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate in the fa@@ vel@@ as goes back to over nine percent above the fa@@ vel@@ as . </s>
so we don &apos;t have to control people , and we can &apos;t be able to be able to do anything bad . </s>
we can support them to be good . </s>
and that is , of course , high-@@ tech agriculture , but the systems are themselves . </s>
the by@@ product is clean water . </s>
and they &apos;re so designed by the design that a farmer can just operate . </s>
that is , you go back to the crime rates . </s>
and none of these facili@@ ties , we &apos;ve now built over 100 , in the last tw@@ enty years , none of these facili@@ tat@@ ors have ever been sab@@ ot@@ ated . </s>
you could just clean up a liter of al@@ ton , and then the plant would be ru@@ ined for years . </s>
not so much . </s>
that is , we don &apos;t have to control people possible to be little bad . </s>
we can support them to be good . </s>
that means we need to get phosphor@@ us back . </s>
and by the way , if you want to do something , you write up , you know , in germany , in germany , in germany , in germany , in germany , it &apos;s going to be in por@@ ts . </s>
unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t seem to open up , but maybe you can help it a little bit . </s>
because the scar@@ ce plant could best return the phosphor@@ us phosphor@@ us . </s>
and he has to come back . </s>
we see phosphor@@ us that phosphor@@ us is really critical . </s>
and we see that it works through . </s>
we &apos;ve been using h@@ oll@@ and in h@@ oll@@ and for over three years now . </s>
the du@@ tch government explained , they will be the first country in the world , which is phosphor@@ us phosphor@@ us . </s>
but we need that overall . </s>
you know , there are two countries that control almost se@@ ven@@ -@@ percent of the phosphor@@ us in the world . </s>
there &apos;s a bunch of op@@ e@@ c cra@@ cking a bunch of or@@ phan@@ ages . </s>
these are 2@@ 2@@ 20 countries that control 40 percent of the oil supp@@ lies . </s>
and the oil is going to replace us with other energy car@@ ries . </s>
but the phosphor@@ us is not going to replace you . </s>
this is not about making the existing a little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right . </s>
and first of all , what &apos;s the right thing to do , what the right thing is . </s>
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency . </s>
in h@@ oll@@ and , you understand that easier , because in h@@ oll@@ and , the country is built on flowers . </s>
yes ? </s>
imagine , for example , if your wife is sad , if you &apos;ve de@@ alt with it , and you come with 50 ro@@ ses . </s>
it &apos;s not in@@ efficient . </s>
but effective and effective , yes ? </s>
or take a li@@ p pen . </s>
a woman in germany e@@ ats about six com@@ ma three kilogra@@ ms in her lifetime . </s>
this is true . </s>
it &apos;s not scienti@@ fically accurate , because we don &apos;t know how much away it is . </s>
but a li@@ p pen , even in this lighting , i can tell you , is completely in@@ efficient , but really effective , yes ? </s>
anything that is beautiful in life is not efficient . </s>
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency . </s>
to ask , what &apos;s the right thing ? </s>
it &apos;s not to burn the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment to burn a little bit better and get it to stop it , and to lose all the materials that are going to lose all the materials , but first of all , how do you make circu@@ lation ? </s>
think of moz@@ art effici@@ ently . </s>
yes ? </s>
if i invite them to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a p@@ ill with open taste and a glass of water . </s>
wonderful , hu@@ h ? </s>
this is efficient . </s>
anything that is beautiful in life is not efficient . </s>
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ? </s>
yes ? </s>
that means everything that coun@@ ts in life is not about avo@@ i@@ ding , avo@@ i@@ ding . </s>
the whole environmental discussion . </s>
we tell people , oh , you know , you have no environmental sense in the south . </s>
no , the thro@@ wa@@ way is exactly the right thing , yes ? </s>
at every point where you throw away , from , yes , you create choices again . </s>
but the wrong things . </s>
when you throw away the wrong thing , you have a waste problem . </s>
in how we think about north . </s>
there &apos;s a footprint that &apos;s dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ged . </s>
when they walk , yes , every footprint does the floor . </s>
because the soil is going to die the mos@@ qui@@ to , and the wind , and the water wash@@ es away the floor . </s>
but if you &apos;re in it@@ aly , every footprint means the water sta@@ ys longer longer in the me@@ a@@ dow . </s>
so , it &apos;s about making a big footprint , which is a we@@ t@@ lands . </s>
not school management . </s>
we &apos;re saying sustainability in germany . </s>
yes ? </s>
but when i ask you , how do you do that with your wife ? </s>
what do they say then ? </s>
sustainable . </s>
then i say , heart p@@ ity , yes ? </s>
this is just the minim@@ um . </s>
so not saving , avoid , avo@@ i@@ ding . </s>
every waste is nutri@@ ent . </s>
and it &apos;s a l@@ ust , when you see in it@@ aly , like , how people in the high bow of this car get out of the car , they kick off . </s>
because , you know , it &apos;s a fun process . </s>
it &apos;s the form of re@@ fourth behavior , yes ? </s>
you can show i was there . </s>
but with the right design , there we go . </s>
so for example , we &apos;ve developed an ice pack@@ aging that &apos;s at room temperature &apos;s liquid temperature . </s>
they can throw them away where they go and stand . </s>
two hours in two hours , they build off . </s>
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re contribu@@ ting by thro@@ wing away bio@@ diversity . </s>
that is , we are useful , not less harm@@ ful . </s>
so there are two roll@@ ers coming out . </s>
not all , of course , to be com@@ po@@ sti@@ ble . </s>
a television or a wash@@ ing machine , they just use it , they don &apos;t use it . </s>
just the things that con@@ tain , like sho@@ e so@@ ils , like bra@@ kes , like je@@ wel@@ ry , they have to be like they &apos;re going to go into biological systems . </s>
the things that are only used in technical systems go into technical systems . </s>
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems . </s>
yes ? </s>
for example , the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , yes ? </s>
very direct adverti@@ se@@ ments , not for the company pu@@ ma , but for the fact that they now help this company success@@ fully make these products successful . </s>
because we don &apos;t make things more free from the things . </s>
yes ? </s>
so when i invite you to eat and say , this is free of cro@@ ps , then you won &apos;t help them . </s>
no , we put what is in there . </s>
positive . </s>
so not like de@@ to@@ x . </s>
not po@@ is@@ on@@ ous in it . </s>
but everything that &apos;s in there is useful . </s>
these are the first shoes that you can put the ca@@ v@@ ali@@ a launch on the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an launch , and the rub@@ ber can go in biology , right ? </s>
all of it is com@@ po@@ sting of it . </s>
and when we succeed , of course , we can do it for adi@@ das , for ni@@ ke , for henry and mau@@ ri@@ tz and the whole tex@@ tile industry . </s>
and that &apos;s half of all the wa@@ ste@@ water problems in the world that are caused by the tex@@ tile industry . </s>
and so they help , and ask them , ask for the people . </s>
hey , pu@@ ma , are you really serious ? </s>
because they &apos;ve shif@@ ted twice the cha@@ ir@@ man of the world now . </s>
and i &apos;m not that sure they &apos;re really going to be working . </s>
so , help me a little bit through that . </s>
but it &apos;s going on . </s>
yeah . </s>
this is what has just been shown . </s>
that &apos;s it . </s>
we can do things like this , that if they disappear , when they go broken , they can be able to do it in biology . </s>
technical loop is the same way . </s>
there is a direct spinal cor@@ d system . </s>
this is the first ecolo@@ gical back@@ pack , in fact , which is designed to go back into the loop . </s>
that too , so in any store , you can get the things back . </s>
if you come on this , right ? </s>
do you remember the need@@ le again ? </s>
if at the moment , the waste is garbage . </s>
these are the win@@ ds everywhere , almost close . </s>
in the countries where people are getting money . </s>
it &apos;s up to the de@@ po@@ ster , but also in the landscape in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , right ? </s>
if we change the plasti@@ cs so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water stor@@ age , they can just go back to the cell@@ ular basis , you can plant with a baby in israel or in tun@@ isi@@ a in tun@@ isi@@ a . </s>
yes ? </s>
just when you take that need@@ le , they sh@@ ine , they take ster@@ ili@@ zing and the po@@ w@@ der , to plant the trees . </s>
so the baby &apos;s carbon positive for the whole life , even from the very beginning . </s>
so , we don &apos;t need to be carbon neu@@ tral . we can be climate positive . </s>
it &apos;s sort of a behavior po@@ op print . </s>
yes , it is . </s>
yes ? </s>
we can do that . </s>
we can rein@@ vent anything again . </s>
i started an institute here . </s>
mean@@ while , there are a lot of people working with this , and you can all engage . </s>
there &apos;s an extra mix of cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le cra@@ d@@ le where everyone can do it . </s>
so no longer save , avo@@ i@@ ded , avo@@ i@@ ded , reduce , not school management , but smart waste . </s>
do you make it curious ? </s>
thank you . </s>
the work of interpre@@ ting . </s>
music as a language . </s>
in the descri@@ ption of my talk , i wrote that i as an interpre@@ t , myself , as a transl@@ ator , i understand , in the english word , understand . </s>
interpre@@ ts are transl@@ ators of the written notes in clinical music . </s>
that as a transl@@ ator , you don &apos;t just deliver the word for word text into another language , but also the deeper meaning of the words and the deeper meaning of the words that it makes a sense of trans@@ lation , everyone who has it to do with foreign languages . </s>
already transl@@ ated from the german into english , can require more knowledge , once you &apos;re about di@@ stra@@ ction or even poetry . </s>
but alien , it &apos;s for la@@ y@@ man , which is what we musicians to do with our music language . </s>
as an interpre@@ t of a piece of music , i just got the written notes . </s>
you think that the com@@ pos@@ er has written exactly everything in the notes , which is what he came up with . </s>
in fact , notes are very va@@ gue and im@@ perfect . </s>
these notes are about as accurate or in@@ accurate , as a verb@@ al , but very seem@@ ingly accurate , descri@@ bing , descri@@ ption of the landscape . </s>
because in this verb@@ al descri@@ ption , the du@@ ck of the flowers is not to smell the degree of fo@@ unding only to hear the sa@@ iling of the wind , not to feel . </s>
that means that the interpre@@ t has to translate these dis@@ gu@@ sting language into another , which is audi@@ tory , concrete , non-@@ verb@@ al music language . </s>
today i want to share with you what i think i &apos;m musical music to do , which is to translate into a verb@@ al language , again , in a verb@@ al language . </s>
basically , a trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation . </s>
so i prefer to do the whole thing to do in german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equal to me with trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation . </s>
so , the music works for me as much as the spoken language for me . </s>
the not@@ e@@ tic notes have a function of the letters of a script . </s>
so it &apos;s not enough to learn just to read gra@@ des and put them on the piano on the piano or the right spot on a vio@@ lin string . </s>
and this is just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint . </s>
the meaning of the letters is only when you can get the language to do so . </s>
so you need to have the learning process of music language at least as long as the spoken word language . </s>
there are also sugge@@ sti@@ ons whether you learn whether you learn it , just passi@@ vely , or you can speak active , or you can speak to the musical native language . </s>
the work of interpre@@ ting starts similar to a theater like a theater director . </s>
after first you &apos;ve chosen to play a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you know , you first research the emergen@@ ce of the emergen@@ ce of the com@@ position . </s>
you accu@@ mu@@ late information through the piece of the sea literature . </s>
you read in the letters , ta@@ pes , notes , or if you have words , thoughts are the com@@ pos@@ ers of the com@@ pos@@ er . </s>
you study the works he com@@ posed before and after . </s>
you &apos;re making compar@@ ison . </s>
the reason to write it is to write . </s>
so how did he feel ? </s>
how were the environments like society and politics and politics ? </s>
all of this is interested . </s>
you think of that time in this time , for example , by looking for contemporary images or literature . </s>
but over time , you also have a rich knowledge about the com@@ pos@@ er that you play more au@@ d@@ aci@@ ous , and it makes you feel easier to think of it and feel in it . </s>
the com@@ pos@@ er is going to be more to the friend that you live together . </s>
his cause to write the piece is become more and more and more and more of my personal concern@@ s for me to play it . </s>
so that notes everything else as an accurate record of the com@@ pos@@ er of the com@@ pos@@ er , but just a framework , i turn this framework to fill it back with meaning and meaning . </s>
i then say , in my own words , what could be written between this framework . </s>
i &apos;m explaining what this sound might have mean to mean . </s>
now for me and for the com@@ pos@@ ers at the time , what they might mean for him today . </s>
every t@@ one , every phrase gets a sense of it , because i feel it myself , because it comes out of my personal schol@@ ar . </s>
it has to be wrong for me in here , and now i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my cause . </s>
it &apos;s always a very happy conc@@ ert when i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been doing so long in the course of trying to experience how new i live . </s>
how to re@@ frame a happy new day , although always with the same ritu@@ als of life , stand up , break@@ fast , go to work , i also en@@ force the same piece back to the new . </s>
i grew up a day older , changing seas@@ ons , my pul@@ se goes down at night than the morning , in a conc@@ ert hall , it takes longer the sound that the sound comes back home than at home . </s>
i take the breathing of the audience true , consciously or un@@ conscious . </s>
all of this impac@@ ts me , and all of this impac@@ ts my experience with the com@@ position . </s>
it &apos;s also wonderful when i stand with a du@@ o partner on the stage , and we have the same wa@@ vel@@ ength . </s>
and then the same happens in a good , sil@@ ly conversation . </s>
you get a new idea in it , and it will be answer@@ ed with a response to a reaction . </s>
it &apos;s exciting because then things that we haven &apos;t focused on this way and what you can &apos;t even understand . </s>
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and you have seen the audience communic@@ ating how the music communic@@ ates alive . </s>
so each conc@@ ert is a different conc@@ ert . </s>
i will never play that way , like in this moment . </s>
i can &apos;t play today as in 20 years . </s>
that &apos;s where i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and therefore i &apos;m going to have a lot more on my pal@@ ette of music sound , much more color , emotions and sen@@ ti@@ ments and emotions than today . </s>
sure , i &apos;m going to have some color po@@ ets out too , but for the new time for this . </s>
have a very nice example of that . </s>
it was on a piano cur@@ sor for music students with my belo@@ ved old teacher , professor j@@ tho@@ gen u@@ de , a famous bee@@ tho@@ ven speci@@ alist , conc@@ ert pian@@ ist and lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty professor of music high school here in stu@@ tt@@ a style . </s>
unfortunately , i was much too young , so he was already emer@@ ged when i finally started studying . </s>
but i was very lucky to meet him very early , when at the age of three , when i was on his classes , i was going to be on his classes for my classes . </s>
i was 17 at the time when i particip@@ ated in one of his classes and played the last of the four bal@@ ances of ch@@ op@@ in ch@@ op@@ in , a recent piece of time . </s>
he asked me what the introdu@@ ction of this bal@@ la@@ ge was for me . </s>
this is such a contract part . </s>
and in my you@@ th , i said , expec@@ tation . </s>
when he was squ@@ e@@ a@@ king and saying , &quot; well , what ? </s>
that has to be the age difference . </s>
because for me , it means memory . </s>
it was over six@@ t@@ y-@@ five . </s>
well , at the age of 17 , you have dreams , but you have no significant memories . </s>
i play this piece again every few years , and it &apos;s always transformed for me , even though not a single note has changed . </s>
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;ll read something new again . </s>
one example of that from a very different area . mon@@ et has painted the ur@@ ro@@ sis x . </s>
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at different day@@ time , in different light . </s>
he transl@@ ated the ur@@ ro@@ sis as he did it , as he saw it , as they did at this moment in this moment . </s>
his personal impres@@ sions of bl@@ ur@@ ses . </s>
the x-@@ mal interpretation of a piece is compar@@ able . </s>
by now , i &apos;ve been older than ch@@ op@@ in at the age of two , when he wrote the piece . </s>
he &apos;s only lived only three years of life . </s>
and it &apos;s important to look back into the notes , even though i mean to be able to memor@@ ize them . </s>
keeping tw@@ ins of tw@@ ins , right with the com@@ pos@@ er . </s>
because the notes are the only connection directly to him . </s>
most of all , if it died already . </s>
well , how do you begin to speak the language of music ? </s>
so i said , you know , it takes about as long as you can have for spoken language . </s>
often the music class is so , you know , you just learn to read the story . </s>
you learn virtually at first before you just speak one word . </s>
you learn to find the sound of the notes on the instrument . </s>
so when all the finger in time and the right as it does in the notes , it will come out , and then come out sounds like this , which sound like music . </s>
when that happens to er@@ ase , the student gets the next difficult thing to do . </s>
they don &apos;t really talk about interpretation of interpretation . </s>
all right , there &apos;s pre@@ st@@ o at the front , this is a quick piece . </s>
len@@ to , slowly . </s>
loud and light marks , f and b , etc . , etc . </s>
this is what most of you here know . </s>
but even if you look at this stuff , it still remains a little bit more technical . </s>
and yet , it &apos;s still not interpretation . </s>
i wonder . </s>
i wonder that you often forget something really basic . </s>
which is , to make music on the instrument that should make your musical musical and feel exist before . </s>
that &apos;s what singing is . </s>
a child who didn &apos;t learn the singing , because it didn &apos;t do the parents , it will not do it by themselves . </s>
it &apos;s like talking about speech learning . </s>
it &apos;s necessary to have your own experiences and idea of music to have another possibility of another possibility , of an instrument , to sound sound . </s>
people who never succe@@ e@@ ded , so never immediately felt with the own body of your own body as it is to make a sound of a sound . </s>
designing a phrase with its own breath . </s>
the musical instrument is the exten@@ sion of our body . </s>
our vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds to sing , our hands and feet to dance . </s>
so the ham@@ mer heads in the piano are the sequ@@ el of my fingers . </s>
the tun@@ e comes from the healthy and the rhyth@@ m from the dance . </s>
the whole narrative with music today is not pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly available . </s>
you don &apos;t need to make yourself music if it &apos;s going to be boring . </s>
no longer necessary to whist@@ le or to sing . </s>
every single music is going to be plat@@ forms , if you will , from the outside of the outside . </s>
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ? </s>
the question i ask , can you not sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ? </s>
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ? </s>
they &apos;re not too late to begin to find out whether they can &apos;t , or learn how to use these little muscles that use the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary , really use the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary . </s>
and you can train that . </s>
or c , because it tells you that they &apos;re un@@ comfortable . </s>
and i said , how much compe@@ tent was this diagno@@ sis ? </s>
have you taken a second or third point or third , how do you think it &apos;s beautiful ? </s>
or d , they don &apos;t like music , and therefore they want to have ni@@ x to do so . </s>
now what i would regre@@ t for , because music is a beautiful , communication thing . </s>
but maybe you can also dis@@ agree with them . </s>
well , you see , no one has to be a candi@@ date candi@@ date at all . </s>
but don &apos;t say please , i don &apos;t understand anything about classi@@ cal music . </s>
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad . </s>
and i said , but surely you can tell if you like it or not . </s>
because i don &apos;t think it says it , i don &apos;t know if i can taste it , because i can &apos;t cook . </s>
so , they don &apos;t give up on food , just because they can &apos;t cook . </s>
so you don &apos;t have to do classi@@ fied in classi@@ cal music because you don &apos;t play an instrument . </s>
listen to consciously and tell you if it ta@@ stes you or doesn &apos;t . </s>
whether the music is too attached to them or sweet . </s>
tell the feeling what you &apos;re feeling . </s>
over time , you get spra@@ yed and want to ur@@ ge something more sp@@ her@@ ical or taste ta@@ stes even fine . </s>
so why do i change now from my audience that it &apos;s also listening to it ? </s>
because the music is a language , and a language is communic@@ ating . </s>
a piece of art@@ work that you never see has no force to work . </s>
the food that was bo@@ iled by a fo@@ ol or a chef has to be e@@ aten and not just looked at or reci@@ pro@@ cal or reci@@ pi@@ ent . </s>
so you &apos;re listening to a music when you &apos;re playing . </s>
it isn &apos;t just a ne@@ at so@@ und@@ scap@@ e . </s>
if in an environment where the adults are doing music , or at least active music , a child grows up , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color is your flower ? </s>
can you play it in blue now ? </s>
and the kid plays , after a pause , instead of a red flower , instead of a blue flower . </s>
and this sounds very different from me before . </s>
so this was the very first beginning of a musical expression of musical expression . </s>
so the first step of an interpretation . </s>
and what happens when you play a piece today that origin@@ ally had been written two , two hundred years ago , or even three hundred years ago ? </s>
mean@@ while , the instruments have pro@@ gr@@ essed . </s>
there was no instrument at the time as an instrument at all . </s>
it wasn &apos;t invented yet . </s>
i think the b@@ ach would have been good if he had the so@@ und@@ scap@@ e of today &apos;s modern val@@ le@@ ys . </s>
i can now have the sounds that the stream has had , on the modern wing , to sound what a b@@ aro@@ que c@@ em@@ bal@@ o can &apos;t be . </s>
and also by bee@@ tho@@ ven , you know that he had heard more than he was already dea@@ f . </s>
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which has been reje@@ cted by an orchestra at the time . </s>
that &apos;s why the com@@ pos@@ ers depend on us to rein@@ vent the pieces . </s>
so you &apos;re listening to what they &apos;ve only thought of in the mind . </s>
and also what you would think of today in the mind . </s>
or what i want to suggest to you today , because what you thought you might be thinking about . </s>
thank you . </s>
do you know what en@@ vy is ? </s>
have you ever been ten@@ ure ? </s>
and how did that feel ? </s>
su@@ ck . </s>
i have a friend who drives a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i . </s>
when i come out , with my little v w pi@@ es@@ el and me next to me , this feeling comes up . </s>
i &apos;m ki@@ dding something through my head . </s>
i say , &quot; ar , what do you need &quot; big car car ? &quot; </s>
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening in the first year half of its value . </s>
and at all , you work much less than i do . </s>
why do i have to afford the n little car car ? </s>
and then i get immediately , that &apos;s un@@ fair . </s>
it &apos;s against justice . </s>
and as i say to the word justice , this is the aw@@ k@@ ward feeling . </s>
our organism has invented a great method to make these un@@ comfortable emotions like en@@ vy simply disappear . </s>
you can try this with words like smo@@ king , or extra@@ ction , or something like that . </s>
i &apos;d like to explain to you today something about this mechanism or something that is un@@ conscious about what you &apos;re un@@ aware of . </s>
the mechanism is out of the lie . </s>
but don &apos;t think of the lie , as you might have heard when people say people say , no one has the inten@@ tion of building a wall . </s>
and then st@@ ack up st@@ ones so he st@@ ops them . </s>
on a lie like this , you can see that the li@@ ar itself doesn &apos;t believe what he &apos;s saying . </s>
and it &apos;s easy to test that he has a very different point in mind . </s>
he &apos;s just dec@@ ei@@ ving them and not themselves . </s>
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about has to do with themselves that they dec@@ ei@@ ve themselves . </s>
you need this lie to get a life gap in order to maintain a self-@@ de@@ ception . </s>
they can bring you less easy , yes , tested or even to collapse . </s>
they need time . </s>
from this time , an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te tells you that you may know . </s>
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l@@ o pic@@ as@@ so once killed a woman . </s>
this woman compla@@ ined about afterwards , and the portrait wouldn &apos;t quite close it at all . </s>
pic@@ as@@ so answers , they &apos;re just waiting . </s>
it always res@@ em@@ bles you . </s>
at this point , when you laugh , you realize how important this gap is , and how much time you need to experience something that artists can share very well . </s>
because artists have a broken relationship to the lie . </s>
the artist shares something with them , and particularly this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see when she just looks into the mirror . </s>
the artist shares something like this , which is what they &apos;re familiar with , when they &apos;re familiar with this art@@ work , when they look at this art@@ work . </s>
and then this aw@@ k@@ ward feeling disappe@@ ars , and it wouldn &apos;t really look like it , and it will always be similar to you . </s>
here , they have this mechanism where we can use the gap as a great invention to stabili@@ ze our lives . </s>
and not just in art , not in terms of fol@@ k , in the myth@@ ology , in stories , in stories , in stories . </s>
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning and asked him who is the most beautiful of all over the country ? </s>
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a beautiful one . </s>
behind the seven mountains and so on . </s>
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty in this real place , the mirror , can &apos;t lie , can &apos;t lie from that true cause . </s>
but we should just be familiar with the fact that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a beauty somewhere else . </s>
here &apos;s what we need to understand under poli@@ cing correc@@ t@@ ness , to bring back over and over again . </s>
we need this lie at this point that keeps us de@@ cent , without that we can &apos;t live at all . </s>
we don &apos;t have only art in art , in terms of man@@ eu@@ ver@@ ability , but also in science such as great lies . </s>
and there is this story from the woman &apos;s bis@@ ho@@ x of wor@@ che@@ ster . </s>
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of species and the ance@@ stry of human beings . </s>
that man should come away from the monkey , and , yes , there would be a common ance@@ stor between people and monkeys . </s>
and then she ran off to her husband and said , this is probably not true what charles there is writing . </s>
the human being is supposed to come from ap@@ e or have a common ance@@ stry . </s>
no , no , it &apos;s not . </s>
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to stop people getting knowledge of it . </s>
why do we have to prevent people from being able to achieve something if it &apos;s true ? </s>
because we can &apos;t live without this li@@ fel@@ ong life . </s>
because we self-@@ de@@ ception , this sense of being great , des@@ cen@@ ding from the highest people , not from a natural creature , not from such an in@@ consi@@ stent bar like an organism that &apos;s still compar@@ able to a stone and other things , and whatever things it is , it &apos;s un@@ sustainable for us . </s>
so , we can &apos;t do these things at all . </s>
we need to stop people getting knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true . </s>
so you can see how slowly these mechanis@@ ms are going up , and what the tra@@ ces look like , the tra@@ ces that lead to something that lead to something else than this great picture of us , i want to give you another story . </s>
it &apos;s a particularly beautiful story , i mean . </s>
my wife told me , she told me . </s>
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told about a student . </s>
an au@@ ti@@ stic student . </s>
she likes to love him especially because he has a tenden@@ cy to honest@@ y . </s>
and she asked him , what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es ? </s>
and that &apos;s where he says , &quot; well , i &apos;m in the fire@@ men . &quot; </s>
and because i &apos;m in the fire@@ men , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ engineering things . </s>
yeah , you feel it when you &apos;re heal@@ ing at this point . there &apos;s something wrong with that . </s>
i told my wife , every time a human being in a moral justi@@ fi@@ cations , the words we use , we should try and replace it by replac@@ ing it through the words . </s>
do that once , and then you learn the sentence . </s>
although i &apos;m in the fire@@ men , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things . </s>
they feel that the real truth is behind the ground . </s>
this is a little bu@@ b that doesn &apos;t care about fire@@ flies . </s>
they &apos;re interested in fire . </s>
but there &apos;s no embarras@@ s@@ ment where we can look around where to learn how to make fire . </s>
there &apos;s only the second best , just the fire@@ men . </s>
that &apos;s where he &apos;s signed . </s>
and also , you don &apos;t say his teacher also , you know , you &apos;d like to put fir@@ es anywhere and enjoy when the fire is going up . </s>
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re consi@@ stent for elimin@@ ating the risks that others do when they just put fire on the fire . </s>
and here you have this little mechanism . </s>
that evidence of this ref@@ using that at the heart of the bu@@ b knew that it was actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that out loud . </s>
here you have this cen@@ sor between the un@@ conscious and the conscious that jum@@ ps right now , without you being able to do anything about it , and the things that you know , that they look very different , that they can sound much better for them and others . </s>
and so just these words , we &apos;re also using these words in the language of poli@@ tically correct speech . </s>
in fact , we know that something else is true . </s>
but we know when we talk about it , the social relations are very sensitive . </s>
we can &apos;t just do that . </s>
it &apos;s impossible to present those things in a society that should work . </s>
so i want to show you what we found in my institute . </s>
according to the logic of this de@@ ception , this self-@@ de@@ ception , the will@@ ing@@ ness , a different reality than the one we actually know in the un@@ conscious know that it &apos;s val@@ id to spread outside . </s>
i want to give you two , maybe three examples . </s>
the first example is predi@@ cting what many of you know and some of you know , very few of you don &apos;t need at all . </s>
i mean the soul . </s>
what &apos;s the soul ? </s>
the soul is such a vio@@ lin , says about lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z . </s>
it &apos;s something which is not about stop@@ p material , material nature . </s>
and if you have people who are the strong belief that they have a soul , or you can also say that the belief that they &apos;ve been brought from the soul to life , then it &apos;s as if the soul is such a mental framework about them , not from matter from meat and blood , a little bit of stone , something like that , to the earth , com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive , play@@ ful , un@@ important , un@@ important , un@@ important , yes . </s>
and from this soul , they think that they somehow somehow in this clou@@ dy nature , in this fun nature , anim@@ a is present in the latin , the lu@@ ci@@ th@@ as , the lu@@ ci@@ th@@ ist . </s>
and if that lu@@ ci@@ fer then po@@ pped over humans , he &apos;s filled with dignity , with spirit , with nature that can only live , just with the soul . </s>
and then he can walk away . </s>
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works . </s>
so she &apos;s supposed to get from outside to human beings . </s>
so we &apos;re supposed to perceive them as something that should be present to our lives . </s>
and if you have this condition in front of you , you get the logic of the logic of the happiness that we experience through a lie to improve our world . </s>
because now you can apply a tri@@ be . </s>
you know , three sentence , you know , still out of school . </s>
so this is a three-@@ sentence that describes the logic of an logic . </s>
this is , by the way , the most difficult part of my talk . </s>
here you need some logic , but also the will@@ ing@@ ness to lie . </s>
it &apos;s so lying that you can just use the logic wrong . </s>
in that tri@@ be , three sent@@ ences are coming in . </s>
the first sentence is , sound cla@@ ims , there is no soul . </s>
so the second sentence is , if sound is right , it doesn &apos;t have a soul . </s>
now there is a third sentence . </s>
i high@@ ligh@@ ted it specifically here . </s>
a third sentence that immediately shows people who have strong sense of a soul for a soul . </s>
they say , who doesn &apos;t have a soul that &apos;s dead and can &apos;t say anything . </s>
and this is what they feel . </s>
here comes the logic in this , yes , in this de@@ ception speech for expression . </s>
you can see it immediately . </s>
the first two sent@@ ences , they &apos;re logical correc@@ tly . </s>
i can say anything . </s>
the logic is not going to tell you the reality . </s>
i can say the kan@@ ker is a man . </s>
and if i &apos;m right , then the guy is going to be a man . </s>
if i don &apos;t have right , the guy is not a man . </s>
the logic doesn &apos;t make any sense of what &apos;s going on . </s>
i can say anything . </s>
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s just true . </s>
so clear , there &apos;s no soul . </s>
second , when he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul . </s>
these things are logi@@ cally correct . </s>
and now we feel our dec@@ lin@@ ing consciousness immediately , and you can do something about it . </s>
it &apos;s a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sent@@ ences and pre@@ tend that the opposite of the first sentence is already pro@@ ven and pres@@ sed . </s>
because in fact , we &apos;d have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not . </s>
but with this logic , which it just uses two sent@@ ences to be logi@@ cally correct , and a third , that looks like he &apos;s having something to do with it , so we can save our lives . </s>
so , we pre@@ tend that it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a soul . </s>
and we &apos;re very happy about this . </s>
we can continue these things in different examples . </s>
in the present moment , we have a whole modern example , which keeps filling up the day new@@ spa@@ pers . </s>
this is another philosop@@ hi@@ cal theme , a bre@@ ad@@ th of philosophy , present in philosophy . </s>
it has to do with this , that we go back into the fourth century . </s>
there was a schol@@ ar called jo@@ han@@ nes bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ us , and after that , the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ ian es@@ el was named . </s>
the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ ian es@@ el is an es@@ el that is made of pure nature . </s>
it doesn &apos;t have this soul . </s>
it &apos;s such a natural thing . </s>
and if you place the exact right in the middle between two equal airport , it &apos;s star@@ ving . </s>
because he doesn &apos;t know what ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack he needs first . </s>
so he &apos;s right in the middle . </s>
that &apos;s how natural things happen . </s>
smo@@ oth forces , with anti@@ stic forces , are dis@@ solving each other . </s>
there is nothing happening at all . </s>
only if you take another example , so if you immediately make a ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack right now , it doesn &apos;t need any reason to reason and nothing . </s>
automatically , he comes to the right thought . </s>
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re sort of driven in nature , you &apos;re determined by the larger pile that attract you right now , you also have the sense that there has to be something like a free will . </s>
and if we &apos;re already here in frank@@ fur@@ t , i remember , i remember the ma@@ x plan@@ k institute for brain science . </s>
there &apos;s a schol@@ ar called wol@@ f sing@@ er , and sometimes you tell sometimes , wol@@ f sing@@ er cla@@ ims , there is no free free . </s>
now , again , we can form the second sentence , and we can say , if wol@@ f is right , it doesn &apos;t have any free free . </s>
these sent@@ ences are absolutely logical and correc@@ tly . </s>
and what we can read almost every day in the day , almost every day , find them in this third sentence . </s>
it looks something like this who has no free freedom , nor can &apos;t be made for its actions and cla@@ ims to responsibility , and so it &apos;s in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate . </s>
again , they have it again . </s>
in fact , you &apos;d have to prove whether there &apos;s such a thing as free freedom . </s>
but the logic of de@@ ception allows us to do it as the first sentence of pre@@ ten@@ ding is wrong , of course , without evidence of the opposite . </s>
and now , you can just , if you want to do anything for yourself , if you want anything to test yourself , especially if you want to make people happy , this courage to lie . </s>
practice this for example , when you meet a person who you can then say , there are no predi@@ cts . </s>
and please , you don &apos;t use the german word for predi@@ cting , which is prophe@@ t . </s>
you can &apos;t call it , that would be a little bit more poli@@ tically in@@ correc@@ tive . </s>
say , there are no predi@@ ctors . </s>
immediately they become one , of course , for which there is such a predi@@ ctor , of course , you can &apos;t prove that . </s>
and you have a problem already . </s>
because while you &apos;re concerned with this , you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no predi@@ ctive , the man is quite happy . </s>
he &apos;s very happy about this because he dec@@ ei@@ ved them . </s>
because he ran it on a fi@@ le that he doesn &apos;t keep up with himself . </s>
because actually , this man is not interested in evidence . </s>
he &apos;s only interested in making yourself free to the need to prove that there are more pri@@ orities . </s>
so , in the way of moving evidence of evidence , you have the mag@@ ni@@ tude of the lie . </s>
and if you &apos;ve got a chance to feel like this again , that three-@@ sentence sen@@ sation of other people are doing it , because you &apos;re going to make others happy , if you don &apos;t remember them that way on this way . </s>
i thank you for your attention . </s>
well , good afternoon . </s>
i allowed myself to ask li@@ l@@ ly if i could mention them . </s>
she &apos;s one of the illu@@ stra@@ tions here of this great event , and i asked myself if i could give a talk here and give my idea my idea . </s>
i have to say , you &apos;ve managed to do it , it was hard to talk about my idea . </s>
and so i might like to introduce my introdu@@ ction that i &apos;m going to try to introduce you to you . </s>
but of course , it &apos;s the sum , of course , a lot of ideas . </s>
i probably heard the two nice girls are still there , and i &apos;m probably hearing about the generation that has gone down for this bad oil image , because i &apos;ve started to study hundreds of millions of dollars to study engineering , technical high school , and today it &apos;s called , i think , k@@ it . </s>
and i &apos;d ski@@ pped it to berlin in the middle of the eigh@@ te@@ ent@@ h years , because i wanted to make renew@@ ables , and that didn &apos;t happen to be in charge . </s>
there was the nuclear research facility , le@@ o@@ pol@@ a sha@@ king . </s>
they all said k@@ f@@ a , the jewish name was called k@@ f@@ a . </s>
they are called proje@@ ctions today . </s>
because a good engineer has either built great cars or nuclear power facili@@ ties . </s>
but this sort of do@@ o@@ f@@ te like &quot; n solar pen@@ dul@@ um , &quot; from a hundred watts from the square meter , that was a toy . </s>
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering system . </s>
i &apos;m the pre@@ mi@@ um kol@@ a person gr@@ ateful that he &apos;d re@@ habili@@ t@@ ated the word again because of the mo@@ i@@ st@@ ure they had no longer use the word , because everything left was bad . </s>
however , that wasn &apos;t the case in the a@@ famous years . </s>
there was such a way that there was self-@@ direc@@ ted alterna@@ tives , and one of them was sitting in cros@@ s@@ berg in multi@@ ten@@ ing , where you thought of the evil . </s>
place of terrorism , but that was the name of dung and wind and solar energy , and i started the middle of the eigh@@ th eigh@@ th . </s>
and yeah , a lot of what &apos;s been said today , i &apos;m very , very stri@@ king because many , many , many beautiful expres@@ sions i &apos;ve also gone through . </s>
i worked in colle@@ ctively for 11 years , which was grass@@ roots . </s>
we were 20 people . </s>
when a no told was the v@@ et@@ op@@ c@@ au@@ p , it was a completely gr@@ atu@@ it@@ ous . i &apos;ve been hard for 10 years for whether i &apos;ve really wa@@ ited whether i really wa@@ sted my great engineering thing , because all the colleagues of my father have always agreed , you know , you put the money out of the window with your kid . </s>
it &apos;s working with in@@ t@@ act . </s>
and this was really , really , very bit@@ ter , and you &apos;re going to come in like this in the same phase , and it appeared to go through a picture , where i asked myself for 10 years , thousands of d-@@ d-@@ mark mark mark , which was still , of course , colle@@ ctively , colle@@ ctively , colle@@ ctively , colle@@ ctively , whether it really should be that great . </s>
and i gave it to six of them , and then we got together with friends with friends i had become the co-@@ fo@@ under of the company , who then became one of the largest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world . </s>
a huge ener@@ ge@@ tic story , but of course , again , we have the problem of a growing company , and we &apos;ve got two millen@@ nia , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to start small and go back and go back to the next topic of the future , and that means that , again , it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s crazy , it starts to say that people say what the hell is , what the hell is , we don &apos;t talk about stor@@ ing . </s>
and i &apos;ve brought a project to you with a project that i want you to imagine . </s>
and the title of the talk was , yes , how you get to a hundred percent renew@@ ables . </s>
and we &apos;ve just started asking with a relatively simple story of questions , where could you use a memory reas@@ on@@ ably well today ? </s>
on this island , this is the island of gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the a@@ z@@ ans . </s>
yes , it &apos;s the data . </s>
there are four and a half thousand people living there . </s>
they now have a renew@@ able energy rate of 15 percent . </s>
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ? </s>
it &apos;s just not technological . </s>
if you build more wind power , the system starts to fail . </s>
i always tell the politicians when they &apos;re looking at our facility in ber@@ lin@@ u ad@@ vis@@ or . </s>
they always say , why ? </s>
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany . </s>
can &apos;t be a problem at all . </s>
but , in fact , we have seven percent in europe , and our network is physically physically the european . </s>
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island . </s>
the question was simple , calcul@@ ated this was two-@@ year 2006 , the first cont@@ acts of the island with the island , but just calcul@@ ated . </s>
how big a battery would be to be a battery , so you &apos;d actually get an island of an island of 20 , 40 , 50 , maybe even se@@ vent@@ y percent renew@@ able . </s>
and yeah , i &apos;ll take a slide back here . </s>
the conventional system looks like this all over the world . </s>
by the way , about a hundred gi@@ ga@@ watts of electricity , by the way , will be built on the planet , by the way . </s>
that &apos;s equivalent to the power of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it goes very fast all over the place . </s>
the energy hunger of the world that &apos;s taking place is del@@ et@@ ed in this world , because you don &apos;t need to have per@@ mission . </s>
this is quick . </s>
you put this in the box . </s>
and then it looks like this in the rule . </s>
and three of them always run out , and two will always be wa@@ ited . </s>
yes , there &apos;s a sees down there , the bur@@ den . </s>
we also got very deta@@ iled data . </s>
and the wind power plant , or the solar system , or whatever it is , is usually a back@@ up system or a back@@ -up system , which is a system which is just in small quanti@@ ties here . </s>
and our goal was to say , okay . </s>
the gut is going to be sha@@ king , and the wind , the sun , the load of the load so that they can form the larger amount of propor@@ tion . </s>
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renew@@ able energy , energy per year , not the power at the moment , you &apos;ve got to turn off the whole thing . </s>
that is , at the moment , you &apos;ve got to make sure that the renew@@ able energy can take over the entire grid . </s>
of course , they can only , of course , be man@@ ned in some way , in any way . </s>
it has no one in the world . </s>
this is in a small scale , so you can use your ra@@ z@@ or in the car for a small trans@@ duc@@ er . </s>
people always ask me , what do you think you &apos;re in ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ of ? </s>
there we go . </s>
but if you want to put together several of these innov@@ ators , and you &apos;re going to build a net , it &apos;s going to become extremely complicated . </s>
and our goal was , we wanted to get to 70 to nine percent renew@@ able renew@@ ables , and then here &apos;s the rest , the last rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renew@@ able , that will be very , very expensive , and that won &apos;t work that you do it from batter@@ ies . </s>
it will be an energy car@@ ri@@ age that then , hydrogen , methan@@ e , power to gas , you know , you know , it will be . </s>
you have to go more than a seas@@ onal stor@@ age and w@@ inter@@ -@@ summer summer , not only ta@@ ke@@ night . </s>
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on with the normal , sm@@ el@@ less electro@@ chemical battery . </s>
now , how far do you get there ? </s>
and then we did a whole bunch of simu@@ lations . </s>
and wind and sun and load and load the load , and then came to the conclusion , a very exciting result , that you take a very exciting result of the conventional system that takes about 50 cents a kil@@ o of a kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t-@@ hour kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t-@@ hour , about 40 to 40 cents a cent . </s>
this was the very first calcu@@ lation six years ago . </s>
and then we said , okay . </s>
well , it &apos;s great , then we have a business model . </s>
we &apos;re cheaper than the waste system , if the price price goes up five percent a year . </s>
and then we started negoti@@ ating with the insulin . </s>
what should be done ? </s>
have negoti@@ ated with inve@@ stors ; i &apos;ve looked for new prison@@ ers . </s>
we were only five people at the time to re@@ build the society . </s>
and here &apos;s the repres@@ entation . </s>
the brown is the conventional system , the green one is our system . </s>
that our system also has a price of price , because we still make 20 percent of this stuff , and we also don &apos;t go through the other thing on the other hand . </s>
and the power@@ -@@ utili@@ ty , which has the electricity supply companies on the island , we find that quite great . </s>
let &apos;s also support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem . </s>
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we can sort of map the electrical propor@@ tion of the island to three to three . </s>
so that means we &apos;ve first looked to find the largest battery in the world . </s>
there it is . </s>
it &apos;s coming from asia , in the case of japan . </s>
and funny , in the &apos; 70s , she was developed at bb@@ c man@@ n@@ heim today , ab@@ road , and then was li@@ fted up to the japanese . </s>
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery . </s>
it has a mega@@ watt power , and it can take six hours for this performance for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;ve sort of taken out of simulation technology . </s>
and then they set up . </s>
we &apos;ve also got one of these curious ag@@ gre@@ gate ag@@ gre@@ gate in the same size as it is there in the hall , and actually the whole dynamic behavior of this network , so in the hall it looks like this , it looks like this in the back , here &apos;s the big battery , here &apos;s the whole trans@@ duc@@ er that we simu@@ late the web . </s>
over here , we can simu@@ late the whole trans@@ mission system , the kilometers of the c@@ ables , to sort of map the vibra@@ tion behavior in the web . </s>
and here you can see the whole thing . </s>
we can also turn two hundred kil@@ o@@ watts of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics onto the net . </s>
so here we can see again , again , again , again , again , the whole ag@@ gre@@ gate here , again , single ag@@ gre@@ gate . </s>
and what we &apos;ve done is , for two millen@@ nia , the hall has been comple@@ ted , until this day , two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half basically what &apos;s been designed between the individual system of electronics to develop software , we &apos;ve done . </s>
so we &apos;re not a battery manufac@@ tur@@ er , but we define ourselves as a company that &apos;s just between the battery and the theme network , and everything in between . </s>
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , and you have to communicate in the grid , and that &apos;s very complicated . </s>
the nice thing about the issue that you basically have on this island today is that everything can happen to problems that we will get if we want to increase our percentage of renew@@ ables . </s>
so this whole discussion , which is right now going up and forth , and energy changes , like , on the island , for example , on the island , we have five to three percent in@@ cen@@ tive energy , so we need the wind and the sun and the sun . </s>
then , natural light offers smart . </s>
so smart string , a huge theme everywhere . </s>
we can start to integra@@ te electro@@ mo@@ bility into the island already , you know , because you can manage the bur@@ den . </s>
that means if you &apos;re at se@@ vent@@ h percent renew@@ able , you won &apos;t be able to do that with any memory . </s>
you can do it through &apos; n smart , you can build through the nets , yes , you should do that in any case , but you &apos;re never going to be able to get rid of memory . </s>
and that &apos;s kind of like the message of the message . </s>
that &apos;s why a lot of people come and look at this , just because you can see what problems you &apos;re getting . </s>
when we turn off the inside of it , you don &apos;t have that ro@@ tat@@ ing mass that causes a certain amount of in@@ er@@ ti@@ a on the web . </s>
and our european network network is basically just taken out of loud ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses of large power plants , where the wave is always ro@@ tat@@ ing all over europe . </s>
we look into this web , see the 50 her@@ tz her@@ tz , and when there &apos;s nine her@@ tz nine her@@ tz , we &apos;re starting to get up a few feet , and then we go back a little bit , again , a little bit of mer@@ h ste@@ am in , and then we &apos;ll get back up . </s>
that &apos;s the system . </s>
and , of course , this is incredible . </s>
if you down@@ load it somewhere , it takes a little while . </s>
the save reser@@ ve is at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable . </s>
and in time , they can react again , again . </s>
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , you have to replace that with power electronics and electro@@ chemistry . </s>
and we can turn out this big battery with two milli@@ seconds a milli@@ second . </s>
and then you can see the enormous speed cap@@ abilities there are . </s>
and the message is , we need to get rid of these ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses , if we sort of tw@@ enty our goals , 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 30 percent and so on , if we want to do that at all . </s>
and then we have to de@@ construct our mu@@ st-@@ run capacity on the web . </s>
mu@@ st-@@ run is simple , the power station is running to keep the frequency . </s>
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , building coal power plants , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or ga@@ ins , because that &apos;s not what it &apos;s about . </s>
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can re@@ build the capacity , the mu@@ st-@@ run capacity , by getting electro@@ chemical memory into the net . </s>
fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of research right now . </s>
and at that point , people always come and look at our trial at the same time that we were in@@ sel@@ ing . </s>
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you take away a piece of far future ? </s>
and many discus@@ sions that i &apos;ve had over the last six years have been similar to the discussion i &apos;ve had over the last 30 years , about photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics . </s>
don &apos;t go on , kid &apos;s kids , you know , child to@@ ol@@ ing , you know , we &apos;re never going to do anything . </s>
we have three gi@@ ga@@ watts of photo@@ vol@@ watt photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics today . </s>
this is pre@@ cious . </s>
and i &apos;m just saying that in the next 30 years , we &apos;ll have the same capacity for electro@@ chemical stor@@ ms all over the world . </s>
simple , this is how it will happen . </s>
there will be a whole bunch of dis@@ abilities and arguments . </s>
and the beautiful thing is that i just experienced in the last two years that the scientists put themselves on my side . </s>
we &apos;ve been getting over 10 million fun@@ ds now , as well as clim@@ bing 10 million mega@@ wat@@ t-@@ battery battery battery to the german net now . </s>
this will happen in april next april . </s>
so you know , from that , you know , there &apos;s a change here , and there &apos;s only change from this pipel@@ ine , to the idea , to the idea , 100 percent renew@@ able . </s>
and if you have a hundred percent renew@@ able , it &apos;s like a au@@ tar@@ or system . </s>
so it &apos;s always been tried in discus@@ sions , these insulin lan@@ ders , who are doing au@@ tar@@ k , they have a little little net , that &apos;s got to do with our ban@@ king and nothing . </s>
now , the question is , the question is , if you &apos;re completely independent from any of the fossil , or ur@@ gent energy , that anywhere in the world will be dri@@ ll@@ ed and taken to you , you &apos;re an island . </s>
and then they just use what &apos;s sun and wind in there , where they live . </s>
and this is kind of a vision of our vision of a sense of reason energy , and i &apos;m gr@@ ateful to cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le as well , that they said they use solar energy . </s>
and that &apos;s what we do , and how we do so , and so , the talk about pre@@ mi@@ um kol@@ a kol@@ a -- that you can again be a colle@@ ctively and use solar energy , and you use a little bit of solar energy here . </s>
and yeah , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little crazy , and you can have a vision . </s>
and you really have to stay there pretty tough , but i think it &apos;s going to be true . </s>
thank you . </s>
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , col@@ om@@ ni@@ an of the los angeles times , went through the streets at the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music . </s>
she came from a man , a afri@@ can@@ -@@ american , sym@@ pa@@ thetic , ra@@ u , hom@@ eless , who played on a vio@@ lin that only had two str@@ ings . </s>
many of you will know the story , because in ste@@ ves article on it , later a book that was fil@@ med with robert dow@@ ney j@@ uni@@ or when steve lo@@ pe@@ z and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x was as a na@@ than@@ iel anth@@ ony a@@ yers , the con@@ tr@@ ist conser@@ ved at the ju@@ illi@@ al conser@@ v@@ atory conser@@ v@@ atory , and whose promis@@ ing career was tra@@ ced early by his par@@ an@@ o@@ id schizophren@@ ia . </s>
na@@ than@@ iel left ju@@ illi@@ ard , suff@@ ered a nerve break@@ down , and 30 years later he lived as hom@@ eless on the streets of sk@@ id row in the center of los angeles . </s>
i recom@@ mend reading all of you , ste@@ ves the book , or watching the movie , so that you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connection that &apos;s happened between these two men , but also how the music helped create that connection and how it finally was the instrument , when this word is allowed to get the na@@ vy , na@@ than@@ iel away from the street . </s>
i met m@@ r a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt dis@@ ney performing hall hall . </s>
he just heard a dem@@ o of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth symph@@ ony , and he came up behind the stage to imagine me . </s>
he was talking to a very sa@@ fer and gre@@ et@@ ed sound about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clinton and about how the do@@ d@@ gers would never get it into the baseball world series , and that all because of the bridge pas@@ sage in the last sentence in the last sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth symph@@ ony . </s>
we got to speak to the theme of music , and a few days later , i got an email that na@@ than@@ iel said that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in teaching me . </s>
i have to mention that na@@ than@@ iel reje@@ cted a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric sho@@ cks and th@@ or@@ a@@ zine and hand@@ she@@ ets , a trau@@ ma that followed him all his life . </s>
as a result , it &apos;s particularly pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ced for these schizophren@@ ic peri@@ ods . they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he disappe@@ ars in the streets of sk@@ id row around the streets of sk@@ ating this hor@@ ror and tor@@ ture of his own mind . </s>
and in this same kind of ri@@ ft stage , na@@ than@@ iel na@@ than@@ iel , when we started our first teaching lesson at the university of dis@@ ney , started hall , and he was completely lost in his eyes to his eyes , and he lost completely lost . </s>
he talked about invisible demon@@ s and smoke and about how somebody wanted to po@@ ur in sleep . </s>
i was scared , not talking about , but i was afraid that i could lose him that he could fall into one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship with the vio@@ lin , when i started talking about pit@@ ches and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic g@@ self-@@ gi@@ go@@ gi@@ a . </s>
so i just started playing . </s>
i was playing the first sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s vio@@ lin conc@@ ert . </s>
and while i was playing , i noticed that in na@@ th@@ ani@@ a , i noticed that there was a complete change in na@@ th@@ ani@@ a . </s>
it was as if he was standing under the influence of a invisible drug , a chemical reaction whose cat@@ aly@@ st was my game . </s>
na@@ th@@ ani@@ an man@@ ic z@@ or@@ n turned into understanding , in a quiet curiosity and a courage . </s>
and like a miracle , he took his vio@@ lin , and he started playing some s@@ ni@@ ppe@@ ts of vio@@ lin con@@ cer@@ ts , and then asked me to play them : men@@ del@@ s@@ son , t@@ cha@@ i@@ ko@@ w@@ ski , si@@ be@@ li@@ us . </s>
we started talking about music , starting from b@@ ach to bee@@ tho@@ ven , bra@@ h@@ ms , bru@@ ck@@ s@@ ner and all the other bs , from bar@@ to@@ k k to es@@ a pe@@ c@@ ca sal@@ ons . </s>
and i realized that he wasn &apos;t just talking about an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia about music , but with her with a close personal relationship with her . </s>
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i just otherwise know about my colleagues in the phil@@ harmon@@ y of los angeles . </s>
by playing music and talking about music , from this par@@ an@@ o@@ id , conf@@ used man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a lo@@ aded , more educated , more educated , more sophisticated musi@@ cian in ju@@ illi@@ ard of ju@@ illi@@ ard . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
music is medicine . music changes us . </s>
for na@@ than@@ iel , music means &quot; se@@ cular health . &quot; </s>
because the music allows him to form his thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions with his imagination and creativity into something real . </s>
and so he runs away with his tor@@ turing states . </s>
i understood that this is the nature of art . </s>
and this is why we make music , so that we have something that is deep inside us , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality . </s>
and the reality that it can get us all , and moves , inspired and come together . </s>
what na@@ than@@ iel did , so he brought the music back into a community of friends . </s>
the er@@ up@@ tion of music brought him back into a family of musicians who recognized him who recognized his talent and roll@@ ed it . </s>
and i &apos;m going to keep playing with na@@ than@@ iel music , whether it &apos;s a lawyer dis@@ ney hall or sk@@ id row , because he re@@ minds me of why i became a musi@@ cian . </s>

i only loved two . </s>
this first one , it was more like a passionate monkey . </s>
it was a beautiful fish , deli@@ cious , good consi@@ sten@@ cy , deli@@ ber@@ ate , a pol@@ lin@@ ator on the men@@ u . </s>
what a fish . </s>
even better , he was raised in aqu@@ ac@@ ul@@ a for the sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly highest standards of sustainability . </s>
so you could feel that you could sell it . </s>
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months . </s>
one day , he called the head of the company , and asked if i could take an event to an event of the farm . </s>
&quot; of course , &quot; i said . </s>
here was a company that was trying to solve what this uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem was for our che@@ fs . how do we keep fish on our men@@ u cards ? </s>
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fis@@ hed the oceans as we &apos;ve seen forests . </s>
it &apos;s hard to over@@ estimate the destruction . </s>
nin@@ et@@ y percent of the large fish we love , the tuna , the cur@@ ves , the sal@@ mon fish , the s@@ lu@@ g@@ fish , they have collap@@ sed . </s>
there &apos;s almost nothing left . </s>
so , maybe it &apos;s going to be good or evil , fis@@ h@@ ul@@ ture , a part of our future . </s>
a lot of argu@@ es about it . fish services , most of the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re in@@ efficient , let &apos;s take tuna . a big dis@@ advantage . </s>
he &apos;s got a feed from 15 to one . </s>
that means 15 pounds of wild fish is needed to get a pound tuna tuna . </s>
not very sustainable . </s>
doesn &apos;t taste very well either . </s>
so here was finally a company trying to do it right . </s>
i wanted to support them . </s>
so the day before this event , i called the head of public work for the company . </s>
let &apos;s call him don . </s>
&quot; don don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for making so far out in the ocean that you don &apos;t poll@@ ute the environment . &quot; </s>
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste will be distributed from our fish , not concentr@@ ated . &quot; </s>
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world . </s>
it &apos;s 2.@@ 5 to 1 , he said , &quot; he said . </s>
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot; </s>
2.@@ 5 to one , great . </s>
&quot; 2.@@ 5 to one ? what fe@@ eds you ? &quot; </s>
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said . </s>
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on . </s>
and i was lying in bed that night , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ? </s>
so the next day i called , just before the meeting , don &apos;t don . </s>
i said , &quot; don &apos;t what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; </s>
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask questions . </s>
now , i phones with some people in the company , and no one could give me a proper answer , until i finally got to the senior biologists . </s>
let &apos;s call him don &apos;t . </s>
&quot; don don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins for example ? &quot; </s>
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ e and some fish me@@ als , and then he said , &quot; chicken pel@@ lets . &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; chicken pel@@ lets ? &quot; </s>
he said , &quot; yes , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , bone fl@@ es@@ h , re@@ te , dri@@ ed and process@@ ed by food . &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; what percentage of real oil is chicken is chicken ? &quot; </s>
pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly , maybe two percent . </s>
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said . </s>
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken in fish ? &quot; </s>
there was a long pause at the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot; </s>
i fell in love with this fish . </s>
no , not because i &apos;m a sel@@ fish and good person . </s>
this is me . </s>
no , i actually loved this fish from this fish , because , i swe@@ ar to god , the fish after that conversation had s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed chicken after that conversation . </s>
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story . </s>
it &apos;s the romantic species , the way in which you know better you know your fish , you love the fish more . </s>
i ate it first in a restaurant in southern spa@@ in . </s>
a journalist journalist had been talking about this fish for a long time . </s>
it sort of su@@ cks us in a certain way . </s>
he came up on the table with a bright , almost sh@@ ining white color . </s>
the chef had coo@@ ked him . </s>
hold twice . </s>
ama@@ z@@ ingly , it was still deli@@ cious . </s>
who can taste a fish so well after he got coo@@ ked ? </s>
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it . </s>
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el . in fact , he &apos;s called mi@@ gu@@ el . </s>
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and it &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way you understand it and i understand it . </s>
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma . </s>
this is a fish fish in the sou@@ th@@ western corner of spa@@ in . </s>
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r . </s>
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of ar@@ gent@@ ina . </s>
they were growing cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l be@@ ds on what were basically we@@ t@@ lands . </s>
they did that by sending the land out of the country . </s>
they built this complicated series of can@@ als , and they put water out of the country and out into the river . </s>
well , they couldn &apos;t make that working , not econom@@ ically . </s>
and ecolo@@ gi@@ cally , it was a disaster . </s>
it killed about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds for this place . </s>
and so in 198@@ 2 , a span@@ ish company bought the country . </s>
what did they do ? </s>
they have rever@@ ber@@ ated the flow of water . </s>
they literally laid out the le@@ vers . </s>
instead of pushing the water out , they used the chan@@ nels to pull the water back . </s>
they f@@ ought the chan@@ nels . </s>
they created a 1@@ 1,000 he@@ ct@@ are of fish -- bar@@ k , se@@ a@@ we@@ ed , shrimp , a@@ al -- and mi@@ gu@@ el -- and his company has completely rever@@ sed the destruction of the ecolo@@ gical destruction . </s>
the farm is incredible . </s>
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this . </s>
they st@@ are out on the hori@@ zon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is cur@@ ved chan@@ nels and this density , abund@@ ant march . </s>
i wasn &apos;t there long time ago with mi@@ gu@@ el . </s>
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three pieces of charles darwin and a part , &quot; a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le for the k@@ is@@ ses . &quot; </s>
okay ? there we were , and we f@@ ought by the we@@ t@@ lands and i swe@@ at and i swe@@ ar , and i swe@@ ar to my k@@ ne@@ es , and mi@@ gu@@ el holding a biology lecture in quie@@ tly . </s>
this is where he puts a rare ther@@ mal equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um . </s>
now he &apos;s looking at the miner@@ als of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton . </s>
and here , he sees a pattern of b@@ und@@ les that remind him of the tanz@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ffe . </s>
it turns out mi@@ gu@@ el spent the most part of his career in mi@@ ze@@ i national park in africa . </s>
i asked him how he became such a fish expert . </s>
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish . </s>
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot; </s>
and then it goes and crash@@ es into more rare birds of rare birds and al@@ ga@@ e and str@@ angel@@ y water plants . </s>
and don &apos;t get me wrong , this was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community , like , in the way , in this way . </s>
it &apos;s great , but i was in love . </s>
and my head was weak about this coo@@ ked piece of deli@@ cious fish that i had on the front of the day . </s>
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , how come your fish ta@@ stes so good ? &quot; </s>
he showed up on the al@@ ga@@ e . </s>
&quot; i know , boy , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships , this is incredible . </s>
but what are your fish eating ? </s>
what &apos;s the secre@@ tary of food ? &quot; </s>
now , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system , that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild . </s>
the plant bio@@ mass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , that &apos;s what feeding the fish . </s>
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-@@ clean@@ ing . </s>
there is no food . </s>
ever heard of a farm that their animals didn &apos;t feed ? </s>
later on the day , i went around this site with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; different than any farm i &apos;ve ever been to , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot; </s>
in the moment , it was as if a film director would have asked a stage . </s>
and we bow around the corner , and we offered the most incredible view , thousands and thousands of pin@@ ker fl@@ amin@@ gos , a literally pink car@@ pet so far the eye . </s>
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said . </s>
&quot; look at her gre@@ e@@ ks , pink . </s>
they &apos;re wi@@ ping . &quot; </s>
worse ? i was totally conf@@ used . </s>
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , don &apos;t you do your fish ? &quot; </s>
and he said , &quot; yes . &quot; </s>
&quot; we are losing 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs in the birds . </s>
now last year , on this site , 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds were more than 250 different species . </s>
it has become the largest and one of the most important private bird reser@@ ves across europe . </s>
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , is a good avi@@ ation of birds not the last thing you want to have on a fish ? &quot; </s>
he sha@@ ved his head , no . </s>
he said , &quot; we build silicon si@@ si@@ v , not inten@@ sity . </s>
this is an ecolo@@ gical network . </s>
the fl@@ amin@@ gos are eating the shrimp . </s>
the shrimp eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton . </s>
so the pin@@ ch@@ and the co@@ at the better the system better . &quot; </s>
okay , let &apos;s re@@ think that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals and a farm that meas@@ ures its success to the health of its predat@@ or . </s>
a fish elev@@ ated , but also a bird reser@@ ve . </s>
oh , and by the way , these fl@@ amin@@ gos should not even be there . </s>
they were bre@@ eding in a city of 2@@ 40 miles away where the soil is better for the nest to nest . </s>
every morning , they fly 2@@ 40 miles to the farm . </s>
and every night it flies back 2@@ 40 miles . </s>
they do it because they &apos;re able to follow the ti@@ mber white line of the country in a@@ 9@@ 2 . </s>
seriously . </s>
and i had a sort of a journey of penguins , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el . </s>
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , do you fly 2@@ 40 miles on the farm , and then fly you 50 miles back to the evening ? </s>
are you going to do that for the kids ? &quot; </s>
he looked at me like i &apos;d just quot@@ ed a song by whit@@ ney hou@@ ston . </s>
he said , &quot; no . they do it because the food is better . &quot; </s>
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my belo@@ ved fish that was deli@@ cious , and i don &apos;t like fish skin , i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . </s>
it &apos;s this comp@@ elling , deli@@ cate taste . </s>
i can never cook almost that . </s>
and yet , when i tried it in this restaurant in southern spa@@ in , she didn &apos;t even s@@ wal@@ low into fish skin . </s>
she ta@@ sted sweet and in it as if you were taking a bi@@ te from the ocean . </s>
i mentioned this to mi@@ gu@@ el and he ni@@ pped . </s>
he said , &quot; the skin looks like a spon@@ ge . </s>
she &apos;s the last dro@@ ple@@ t before something into the body . </s>
it has evolved over the course of evolution to look for un@@ ic@@ or@@ ns . &quot; </s>
and then he said , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have any in@@ door . &quot; </s>
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that meas@@ ures its success at the success of its predat@@ or . </s>
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that has no dis@@ pu@@ tes , he under@@ stands tremendous , because the water that comes through through this farm comes from the river gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r . </s>
it &apos;s a river that leads all of the things that ri@@ vers from the ri@@ vers of the ri@@ vers today , with chemical pollu@@ tan@@ ts , chemical pollu@@ ts of p@@ ills . </s>
and when it f@@ ought through the system , and this leaves is the water cle@@ aner as it is coming in . </s>
the system is so healthy , it cle@@ ans the water . </s>
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that meas@@ ures their success to the health of their predat@@ ors , but a farm that is literally a water plant plant , and not only for these fish , but for you and me . </s>
because when the water flows out , it sin@@ k in the atlantic . </s>
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love story , as romantic as it is , is also star@@ t@@ ling . </s>
you might say that it &apos;s a reci@@ pe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bar@@ k or fl@@ es@@ h . </s>
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one in which food ta@@ stes actually ta@@ stes well . </s>
but for a lot of people , this is a little too radical . </s>
we &apos;re not reali@@ stic , we &apos;re enjo@@ y@@ able . we &apos;re lo@@ vers . </s>
we love farmers &apos; markets . we love small family . we talk about local food . we eat bi@@ o . </s>
and if they claim that these are the things that the future of good foods are as@@ ser@@ ting somewhere else and says , &quot; hey guys , i love pink fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how are they going to feed the world ? </s>
how will they feed the world ? &quot; </s>
may i be honest ? </s>
i don &apos;t like that question . </s>
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to feed the world more than just feeding . </s>
a billion people are going to star@@ ve today . </s>
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- due to distribution ine@@ qualities in distribution , not total production . </s>
now , i don &apos;t like this question because they &apos;ve defined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years . </s>
add grain grain grain cro@@ ps , p@@ ill f@@ loo@@ ds on mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals on the earth , chicken chicken , and all the time , the agricultural industry has just asked , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how bad can it be ? &quot; </s>
that was the cause . it was the justi@@ fication . it was the business plan of american agriculture . </s>
we should call them what it is , an ac@@ quisi@@ tion of de@@ br@@ is , a commercial that en@@ ables ecolo@@ gical capital that en@@ ables that production to happen . </s>
this is not a business , and it &apos;s not agriculture . </s>
our grain cham@@ ber is today threat@@ ened by today , not by taking away , but by rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing resources . </s>
not through the latest mice and tra@@ c@@ tor@@ ian innovations , but through ferti@@ le land , not by pump@@ s , but fresh water , not through cha@@ ins , but forests , and not by fishing and nets , but by fish in the sea . </s>
they want to feed the world ? </s>
so let &apos;s start with the question : how do we feed ourselves ? </s>
or better , how can we create conditions that enable each community to feed themselves ? </s>
in order to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural model for the future . </s>
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done . </s>
capital , chemistry and machines are in the o@@ ven , and it has never produced anything really good for food . </s>
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecolo@@ gical model . </s>
and this is the two billion years of work that &apos;s going on . </s>
look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el . </s>
businesses that are not worlds for themselves , businesses that are re@@ stor@@ ing , rather than using , businesses , rather than just inten@@ sity , farmers that are not just gener@@ ic , but experts in relationships . </s>
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts for fla@@ vor . </s>
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be . </s>
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be deli@@ cious . </s>
thank you . </s>
now , if i want to close with you today , it &apos;s that the whole data of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , i want you to think about how we can use information so that we can make patterns , and we see trends that otherwise would not be visible . </s>
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical die diagram of age . </s>
so the program that i use here is a little bit of a experiment . </s>
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t , and what i can do with pi@@ vo@@ t is that i can filter out after a particular death cause , let &apos;s say accidents . </s>
and immediately , i see another pattern that comes out . </s>
and that is , because in the middle section there are the people who are most active , and they &apos;re over here . </s>
we can go one step further , and then we can re@@ ar@@ range the data and see that ro@@ ot@@ ed disease and cancer are the usual suspe@@ cts , but not for everyone . </s>
if we go on and out of age , say , say , 40 years or more , we see that accidents are actually the main thing that people should care about . </s>
and you can see who &apos;s particularly true with men . </s>
so you can see that this looks at information and data in this way very much from swimming in a living information graph . </s>
and if we can do that for raw data , why not for content itself ? </s>
so what we have here are the cover images of every single individual illu@@ str@@ ator that has ever been prin@@ ted . </s>
it &apos;s all over here . it &apos;s all online . </s>
you can test it after my talk in your th@@ or@@ ds . </s>
pi@@ vo@@ t : you can dive into a decade . </s>
they can enter into a certain year . </s>
you can jump directly to a particular output . </s>
so when i look at this , i see the athle@@ tes that appear in this en@@ core and the sports types . </s>
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce arm@@ strong fan , so i click on this spending all the expen@@ ses in which lan@@ ce arm@@ strong is mentioned . </s>
now , if i want to get a bigger over@@ view , i might think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the subject ? &quot; </s>
so i &apos;m going to step back and take a look at the perspective . </s>
now i see gre@@ g le@@ moon . </s>
and so you get an idea that if you go through this kind of information , if you look at this kind of information , you zoom in , you zoom in , you zoom in , you don &apos;t search or you don &apos;t search or sur@@ f . </s>
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different . </s>
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it can change the way that information can be used . </s>
so i want to take this idea a little bit further , just like what &apos;s a bit crazy . </s>
and what we did here is we took each other &apos;s wi@@ pe@@ di@@ ts and we reduced them to a small sum@@ mary . </s>
and the sum@@ mary has a short over@@ view , and a symbol of the area that it comes from . </s>
i &apos;ll just show you the top 500 of the most popular wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ ans . </s>
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things . </s>
immediately , we have a sense of the issues that are most popular on wikipedia . </s>
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government . </s>
now , after i chose the government , i realize that the wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ ac@@ at@@ ories , which are most of all this year &apos;s time magazine , are people of the year . </s>
this is really important , because this is a reali@@ zation that doesn &apos;t exist in a single wiki@@ pe@@ te . </s>
it &apos;s only to recognize when you go back one step and look at it all . </s>
so , looking at a particular sum@@ mary of these sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can go into the theme of time magazine &quot; people of the year , &quot; and see everyone together . </s>
now , if i look at all of these people , i realize that the majority of these are government offi@@ ci@@ als -- some come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes out of the music area . </s>
and interestingly , bon@@ o is also a ted prize w@@ inner . </s>
so we can jump now and look at all the ted prize w@@ inn@@ ers . </s>
you see , we sur@@ fing the web for the first time as if it &apos;s really a web , not just from page to page , but much more abstract . </s>
and so , i want to show you something that could be a little surprise . </s>
i &apos;ll just show you the new york times website here . </s>
pi@@ vo@@ t , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can look at websites -- and we bring this zo@@ om@@ -@@ technology to every single website like this . </s>
so i can go back a step , and i can jump right into a specific se@@ ction . </s>
so this is important , because you can only look through websites in this way , in this way , to look at the entire internet trajec@@ tory in the same way . </s>
so i can zoom in my course in a certain frame of time . </s>
here &apos;s the whole demonstration of the whole demonstration that i gave here to this point . </s>
and i can re@@ cover everything i &apos;ve looked at today , again , again . </s>
and , if i go back a step and look at everything , i can re@@ ar@@ range my way for my search past , and here i was looking for &quot; ne@@ ver@@ ti@@ stic , &quot; or i &apos;m looking at live labs , or live labs here . </s>
and from here , i can go into the site and call them back . </s>
it &apos;s a metaphor which is always used again , and every time it makes the big picture larger than the sum of the fi@@ bers . </s>
right now , in this world , we think data is a cur@@ se . </s>
we &apos;re talking about the cur@@ se of information trans@@ it . </s>
we &apos;re talking about &quot; dro@@ w@@ ning information . &quot; </s>
what if we could turn this situation around and put the internet on its head , so that instead of going from one to the other , we start to go from many things to many things , and to see patterns that would be otherwise hidden ? </s>
if we can do that , this current data tra@@ p becomes , perhaps , a new source of information . </s>
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge out of it . </s>
and when we know knowledge , then maybe we can even draw wisdom out of it . </s>
this is what i hear . thank you very much . </s>
i grew up with a heard amount of science fiction . </s>
in my school years , i went to school to school every day for an hour per day . </s>
and my nose always went into a book , a sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fiction book , which led me to other worlds in other worlds , and in a nar@@ row way , my deep sitting in my head , un@@ seen curiosity . </s>
this curiosity also showed me that when i was not in school , when i was flying through the forests , i walked through the forests and &quot; samples &quot; collected , collected fro@@ gs , fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and pon@@ ds and pon@@ ds and pon@@ ds , everything brought home home and looked under the microscope . </s>
i was completely excited , you know . </s>
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the limits of the possible . </s>
and my love of science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explor@@ ed the deep sea . </s>
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au came into our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of mira@@ cles that we could never imagine before . </s>
well , that &apos;s probably okay for the science of science fiction . </s>
and i was a perfor@@ mer . </s>
i could draw . i could paint . </s>
and because it wasn &apos;t video games that were monit@@ oring with computer-@@ generated movies in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head . </s>
and we all had to read that at the time . when we read a book as a child , we took the descri@@ ption of the author , we proje@@ cted them onto the can@@ v@@ as in our heads . </s>
so my response to this was drawing and painting by alien , alien worlds , robots , spac@@ ec@@ raft and all that sort of thing . </s>
in math class , i was caught by the teacher hi@@ ding from the teacher text@@ book around , painting around . </s>
the creativity had to stop out . </s>
and something interesting happened , which was interesting to me by jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ in &apos;s shows , which was the thought of a completely un@@ familiar world on our earth itself . </s>
certainly , i would never be an alien world with a spac@@ es@@ hip , and it seemed pretty unlikely to me . </s>
but here was a world that i could actually walk on , here on earth , and it was as fascinating and ex@@ otic as all i had always imagined when i read these books . </s>
so i decided , when i was 15 years old , i decided to be do@@ om@@ ed . </s>
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 3,000 miles away from the near@@ est ocean . </s>
i didn &apos;t let myself out of that . </s>
i put my father up until he finally did a sub@@ urban in buff@@ al@@ o , new york , right on the other side of the border where we lived . </s>
i made my dive in a pool of the ym@@ ca in buff@@ al@@ o , new york . </s>
but the ocean , a real ocean , only did i get to face two years later when we moved to california . </s>
since then , in the 40 years that &apos;s gone by now , i &apos;ve spent about three hours underwater underwater : 500 hours of it in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles . </s>
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat ocean , is as rich as we can &apos;t imagine it . </s>
the fan@@ t@@ asy of nature doesn &apos;t know any boundaries , especially unlike our own , clear human imagination . </s>
until today , i feel deep a@@ we for what i see on my sub@@ mer@@ sible . </s>
and my love to the ocean keeps with the same inten@@ sity as e@@ h and ever . </s>
when i looked at a job as an adult , it was film@@ making . </s>
that seemed like the best way to tell my inner ur@@ ge to tell stories , with my need to create images , to uni@@ te . </s>
as a child , i constantly drew com@@ ic books and things like that . </s>
so movies were the way to bring images and stories together . the fit together . </s>
of course , the stories i was looking for from the science fiction : &quot; termin@@ ator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot; </s>
in &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i could connect my pre@@ fer@@ ences for the underwater world , and the diving with the film@@ making . </s>
so , basically my two passi@@ ons disappeared . </s>
something interesting happened in &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss : &quot; to solve a narrative problem in this film -- and that &apos;s when we had to create some kind of liquid water -- we had to deal with computer-@@ generated animation , c@@ g , back . </s>
and what came out was the first computer-@@ generated software sur@@ et figure character that was ever seen in a movie . </s>
the film didn &apos;t have a money , in fact , he played his production cost , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like h@@ yp@@ noti@@ zed by the magic that went out of it . </s>
according to arthur clar@@ ke &apos;s law , he &apos;s known to have advanced technology and magic magic not to tell each other . </s>
so they saw something ma@@ gical . </s>
and i found that incredibly exciting . </s>
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , it &apos;s got to be brought up in film@@ making . &quot; </s>
so we went to &quot; termin@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next film , much more . </s>
along with sty@@ les , we created the guy &apos;s liquid metal , and the success was all about how this effect would come . </s>
and it worked . again , we had created something ma@@ gical , and the impact in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve played a little bit more money on the movie . </s>
from those two experiences , a whole new world has been achieved , a whole new world of creativity for fil@@ ming . </s>
so i started a company , along with my good friend stan win@@ ston , who was at that time of the best ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up and cre@@ am designer designer , and it was called &quot; digital do@@ main . &quot; </s>
the basic idea of this company was to ski@@ p the phase of op@@ tical printing with op@@ tical printing and start with digital produ@@ ctions . </s>
so we did that , and we managed to do a competi@@ tive advantage for a while . </s>
but in the mid@@ - &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the cre@@ ator of cre@@ ator design , which we actually started out of the company -- too slow . </s>
i had written this piece called &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; which meas@@ ures the meas@@ ures of visual effects and computer-@@ generated computer-@@ generated effects , with reali@@ stic human characters , expres@@ sive characters that were made by c@@ ough , and the main characters should be c@@ ough . and the world should be c@@ ough . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
but the kni@@ fe put it back in a very nice way , and the people in my company told me that we were not going to be able to do that . </s>
so i shot that , and i made this other movie about the big ship that under@@ goes . </s>
i sold this as &quot; ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ t &quot; on a ship . it became a love film ep@@ iso@@ de , a passionate movie . </s>
but , secre@@ tly , i wanted to dive to the real w@@ re@@ ck of the titan@@ ic . </s>
that &apos;s why i made the film . </s>
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that . </s>
but i convinced her , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to dive to the w@@ re@@ ck@@ age . we &apos;re fil@@ ming the real w@@ re@@ ck . </s>
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie . </s>
this is hu@@ gely important . it &apos;s a good pro@@ position for marketing . &quot; </s>
and i persu@@ aded them to fund an expedition . </s>
sounds crazy . but this goes back to what your imagination can create a reality . </s>
we actually created a reality later six months later in which i found myself in a russi@@ an sub@@ mer@@ sible , four miles below the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titan@@ ic titan@@ ic eye eye . </s>
this was not a film , no h@@ d , that was real . </s>
so , that really ble@@ w my mind . </s>
and the prepar@@ ation was enormous . we had to build cameras and head@@ lights and everything . </s>
and i noticed how much these deep@@ -@@ sea things res@@ em@@ ble , a space mission . </s>
well , they were also high-@@ tech and en@@ danger@@ ed more sophisticated planning planning . </s>
you go into this cap@@ su@@ le , you &apos;re floating down into this dark , ho@@ sti@@ le environment where there is no hope for rescu@@ e if you don &apos;t get it back . </s>
and i thought , &quot; wow , it &apos;s as if i &apos;m in a sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fiction film . </s>
it &apos;s really cool . &quot; </s>
i was quite obsessed with studying the deep sea . </s>
anyway , the piece that has to do with curiosity and science -- it was all . it was ad@@ venture , it was curiosity . it was imagination . </s>
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me . </s>
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the window . </s>
some of the following expedi@@ tions i &apos;ve seen in ther@@ mal sources , and sometimes things i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that have never been seen before , and science at the moment when we saw them , had no words yet . </s>
so that was really different from me , and i wanted to go more . </s>
and so i came up with something unusual decision . </s>
after the success of &quot; titan@@ ic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i &apos;m going to put my main prof@@ ession as a film@@ maker in hollywood , and i &apos;ll go for a while for a while for a while . &quot; </s>
and then we started , we walked into &quot; bis@@ mar@@ ck , &quot; and they explor@@ ed it with robots . </s>
we went back to the titan@@ ic w@@ re@@ ck of the titan@@ ic . </s>
we took little robots that we built , which took off a fi@@ ber@@ glass cable . </s>
our in@@ tent was to dive in and see the inside of the ship , which had never been done before . </s>
no one had ever explor@@ ed the inside of the w@@ re@@ ck . you didn &apos;t have any means for it , so we developed the technology . </s>
so here i am , on the de@@ ck of titan@@ ic , in a dive in a sub@@ mer@@ sible , and see plan@@ ks that look pretty much like these boards here , and i know that once the band has played there . </s>
and i fly with a little robotic experience through the hall@@ s of the ship . </s>
i &apos;m actually just paying it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle . </s>
it felt like i was physically within the shi@@ pping w@@ inner of the titan@@ ic . </s>
and this was the most sur@@ real form of a d@@ é@@ j@@ am v@@ u that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i did a corner of a corner , i always knew what would happen in the light of the vehicle of the vehicle , because i was running months of film when we turned the film turned . </s>
the set was an accurate copy of the blue@@ prints of the ship . </s>
so this was a very strange experience . </s>
and it made me realize this tele@@ presence experience that you use such robotic a@@ vat@@ ars and you can use your own awareness to the vehicle , into that other form of existence . </s>
it was really terri@@ bly pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly profound . </s>
and maybe a little look at what might happen in a number of decades when you have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies to explore something or do other things , in all sorts of post-@@ human@@ e fu@@ tur@@ os that i can think of as a science fiction fan . </s>
after these expedi@@ tions , we started learning what we were seeing down there , really appreciate these deep@@ -@@ sea sources , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are kind of alien animals , but they &apos;re kind of alien , but here on earth . </s>
they live with chemo@@ syn@@ thesis . </s>
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight based system , as we do . </s>
and this is how you see animals right next to 500 degrees cel@@ si@@ us that they can survive there . </s>
at the same time , i was also very interested in space science , which was again sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fiction influence from my childhood . </s>
and so i ended up with the people who have been interested in space and doing nasa with nasa , and sitting in the nasa council council and real space mis@@ sions . they go to russia to russia , they go through the mission of the bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal proto@@ co@@ l proto@@ co@@ l and then , then , fly into the international space station , and take our 3d camera with them . </s>
that was fascinating . </s>
but at the end of the day , it was that i took space scientists with us to the deep sea . </s>
i took them with them and for@@ got access to the world : astro@@ biologists , planet@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources so they could take around , take samples and test instruments , and so on . </s>
we made docum@@ entary films , but we actually did science , and we said , &quot; space science . &quot; </s>
so , the circle between my existence as a sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fiction fan was at that time as a child , and the imple@@ mentation of reality . </s>
in the course of this discovery journey , i &apos;ve learned a lot . </s>
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i certainly think a director can also lead to a leader like a ship cap@@ tain or something . </s>
but i didn &apos;t know much about leadership before i joined these expedi@@ tions . </s>
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what are i doing here ? &quot; </s>
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot; </s>
these sil@@ ly movies don &apos;t bring us any money . </s>
we &apos;re just playing the production costs ; the f@@ ame doesn &apos;t make any tra@@ ce . </s>
everybody thinks i was walking between &quot; titan@@ ic &quot; and &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; and &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; walk somewhere on a to@@ we@@ l on the beach somewhere . </s>
i &apos;ve all made these movies , these docum@@ entary films , for a very small audience . </s>
no f@@ ame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ? </s>
you &apos;re doing it for the task , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that is . you make it from the discovery of exploration , and because of the weird connection that comes when a small group of people form a team . </s>
because we &apos;ve done all this with just 10 to 12 people who have been working together for years , and sometimes we &apos;ve been two to three months in the sea . </s>
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the awareness that you have in front of each other , because you &apos;re dealing with a task that you can &apos;t explain . </s>
when you go back to country and say , &quot; we &apos;ve had to do it , the fi@@ ber@@ glass , the so@@ und@@ scap@@ e , and the whole technology , the whole technology , and the difficul@@ ty of human performance , when you &apos;re working at sea , you can &apos;t explain the other one . it &apos;s like police or soldiers that have gone through something together and know that you can never explain it . </s>
there &apos;s a connection , there &apos;s a mu@@ tual respect . </s>
so when i came back to ro@@ tate my next movie &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership style , which is that you respe@@ cted your team and deser@@ ve your respect to your respect . </s>
it really changed the dynamic . </s>
so there i was again with a small team of unknown terrain terrain , and we turned &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t have yet . </s>
incredibly exciting . </s>
it &apos;s an enormous challenge . </s>
and we were , for a period of four and a half years , to a real family . </s>
it changed my way of making films , completely . </s>
there were people who said we would have done these oceans really well , and transpor@@ ted on the planet p@@ and@@ ora . </s>
for me , it was more of a principle to do my job , the real process that has changed the outcome . </s>
so what can we conclude with all of this ? </s>
what lessons have we learned ? </s>
i think the first thing is the curiosity . </s>
it is the most powerful human quality . </s>
our imagination is a force that can even make a reality . </s>
and the rise of your team is more important than all of the lor@@ ds in the world . </s>
to me , young film@@ makers who say , &quot; give me a advice of how i can do something like this . &quot; </s>
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t focus on yourself . </s>
they get it already for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t bet on yourself . but take risks for you . &quot; </s>
nasa has this favorite sentence : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot; </s>
but in the art and explore , failure has to be an alternative , because that &apos;s where it guaran@@ te@@ es it . </s>
no major en@@ dea@@ vor , dem@@ anding that innovation , was ever ac@@ ted with any risk . </s>
you &apos;ve got to be willing to take those risks . </s>
that &apos;s the thought that i &apos;d like to leave you with -- failure is an alternative , but fear is not . thank you . </s>
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate . </s>
and this may surprise something , because my full-@@ time job at the foundation was mainly about vaccin@@ es and seeds , about the things that we need to make and deliver to the poorest 2 billion lives a better life . </s>
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , especially more important than anyone else on the planet . </s>
climate change means that their seeds don &apos;t grow over many years ; it will rain too much or too little . the things will change how it can not stop their fragi@@ le environment . </s>
that leads to star@@ vation . it leads to un@@ certainty . it leads to un@@ rest . </s>
so , a climate change will become terrible for you . </s>
and also , the energy cycle is very important for them . </s>
the fact is , if you could reduce the price from one thing , to poverty reduction , energy would be the most effective . </s>
well , energy rice is over time . </s>
in fact , the advanced society is based on energy advan@@ ces . </s>
co@@ hl@@ al evolution drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a ra@@ pid case in the electricity cycle , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air condi@@ tioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things . </s>
so we are in a wonderful situation with power in the rich world . </s>
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price cut -- let &apos;s hit a new bar@@ rier , and this bar@@ rier depends on co2 . </s>
co2 war@@ ps the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear . </s>
it su@@ cks up the amount of co2 , which leads to temperature elev@@ ation , and that has some very negative effects . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the indi@@ rec@@ ty result that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to such ra@@ pid changes and come up with whole systems . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
now , the exact cor@@ relation between a co2 rise and the resul@@ ting temperature and where the other consequences are , there are some ambi@@ gu@@ ity , but not very many . </s>
and there &apos;s certainly no doubt about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad . </s>
i &apos;ve asked the top scientists a few times , &quot; do we really need to get down to close zero ? </s>
isn &apos;t it enough or a quarter ? &quot; </s>
and the answer is , until we get close zero , the temperature will continue to increase . </s>
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge . </s>
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a three-@@ foot truck , which has to be under a three-@@ foot bridge , and you can just squ@@ ee@@ ze underneath it . </s>
this has to go down , zero , to zero . </s>
well , we &apos;re coming out a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons . </s>
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one . </s>
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for each one on the planet . </s>
and somehow we have to make changes that lower up to zero . </s>
it has happened constant in a while way . </s>
only different economic changes have actually influ@@ enced it , and we need to go from ra@@ pid increase to reduce rise , and reduce it to zero to zero . </s>
this equation has four factors . a bit of multipli@@ cation , they have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that they want to get to zero , and that will be dependent upon the number of people that use each person on the average , the average energy , the average energy for each service and the co2 , which is em@@ it@@ ted per energy unit . </s>
so let &apos;s look at each factor every factor and think how we can get it to zero . </s>
probably one of those numbers has to come very close to zero . </s>
now this is fundamental al@@ ge@@ bra , but let &apos;s take it through . </s>
first , we have the population . </s>
today , 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people live . </s>
and it sp@@ ends to 9 billion . they move to 9 billion . </s>
if we succeed with new vaccin@@ es , the health care and re@@ production medicine , we could probably reduce that by 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the moment , we &apos;re going to see a slo@@ pe by 1.@@ 3 . </s>
the second factor is the services that we use . </s>
this en@@ ables all the food we eat , clo@@ thing , television , he@@ ating , he@@ ating . </s>
these are very good things and poverty reduction in making these services accessible almost everyone on the planet . </s>
it &apos;s great that this number goes up . </s>
in the rich world , in the top billion , we could probably make and use less , but on average , that number will increase every year and more than double than dou@@ bled the number of services that are per person per person . </s>
so here &apos;s a very basic service . are there home lights so you can read your home@@ work ? </s>
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school assign@@ ments under the street . </s>
well , with efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news . </s>
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up . </s>
because of various success@@ es in the light sector , through other au@@ ction patterns , through new methods in house@@ hold , there are many services whose energy costs some individual services by 90 percent . </s>
in other services , like the production of fertili@@ zer , 10@@ 5 00 : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 6@@ ,000 -- 5@@ 6@@ ,000 -- 5@@ 8@@ ,000 or air traffic , or air traffic , is a very much smaller place for impro@@ ving impro@@ v@@ ements . </s>
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we &apos;ll get a reduction by a factor of three or maybe a factor of six . </s>
but in the first three factors , we &apos;ve now gone from 26 billion to maybe 13 billion tons of mass , and that &apos;s simply not enough . </s>
so let &apos;s take a look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s em@@ it@@ ted per energy unit . </s>
it beg@@ s the question of whether you can get it to zero . </s>
when they burn coal , no . </s>
when they burn natural gas , no . </s>
almost every method for electricity now em@@ it@@ ted co2 , except for renew@@ able energy and nuclear power . </s>
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system . </s>
we need energy mira@@ cles . </s>
now , when i use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible . </s>
the micro@@ process@@ or is a miracle . the computer is a miracle . </s>
the internet and its service is a miracle . </s>
the people here have contribu@@ ted to the development of many of these wonder@@ s . </s>
normally , there is no dead@@ line that you need a miracle to a certain date . </s>
usually you &apos;re just sitting next to me and some are not getting other people . </s>
but in this case , we have to get full gas and get a miracle in very short order . </s>
now , i wondered , how can i actually do this ? </s>
is there a natural illu@@ stration , a demonstration that dis@@ plays the idea of people here ? </s>
i remember@@ ed last year when i brought mosqu@@ itos , and somehow people liked it . </s>
the idea became really tan@@ gible for them , you know , that there are people who live with mosqu@@ itos . </s>
for energy , this is what i came up with . </s>
i decided that the release of fire@@ flies would be my contribu@@ tion to the environment here . </s>
so here are some natural fire@@ flies . </s>
you assu@@ red me that they don &apos;t bi@@ te , and in fact , they won &apos;t even leave the glass . </s>
well , there are all kinds of play solutions like this , but they don &apos;t all do much . </s>
we need solutions , either one or several that have an in@@ concei@@ vable sc@@ aling and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able reli@@ ability , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for it , i really see five that can afford these big dem@@ ands . </s>
i &apos;ve left time , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion and bio@@ fuels . </s>
it may make a modern contribu@@ tion , and if you expect better than i expect , that would be great , but my core statement here is that we have to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they have significant problems . </s>
let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels , burning of either coal or natural gas . </s>
what you have to do is just seem simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to capture all the co2 that comes out of the burning block , catch under pressure , and then ev@@ a@@ por@@ ate somewhere , and then hope it will stay there . </s>
there are some pilot projects that are moving on a 60 percent level -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get 100 percent , and an agre@@ ement for getting co2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the cam@@ el question . </s>
who is going to make it ? </s>
who can guaran@@ tee something that literally many billion times bigger than any kind of waste you can imagine from nuclear and other things ? </s>
that &apos;s a lot of volume . </s>
so this is a tough nu@@ t . </s>
next , nuclear power . </s>
it also has three big problems : the cost , especially in highly regul@@ ated countries , the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human contribu@@ tion that the fuel is not used for weapons . </s>
and what do you do with the waste ? </s>
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of thinking . </s>
so three very difficult problems that might be solved , and that &apos;s why you should work on this . </s>
i sum@@ mar@@ ized the last three out of the five . </s>
it &apos;s the renew@@ able energi@@ es , as they say . </s>
and also they have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some dra@@ w@@ backs . </s>
one is the energy density that these technologies make dramatically lower than those of power stations . </s>
these are energy bul@@ bs , you &apos;re talking about lots of square kilometers , 1,000 times more than a normal power station . </s>
and these sources are also inter@@ rup@@ ted . </s>
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all the day , it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and the wind doesn &apos;t always change the wind . </s>
that &apos;s why , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you &apos;ve got a way of getting the energy in times when it &apos;s not available to be available . </s>
so there are huge pri@@ zes here . there are challenges in trans@@ mission , and if we say that the energy source outside of the country is , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you don &apos;t need the technology to deal with the risk of where the energy comes from . </s>
and there &apos;s the war@@ ping problem . </s>
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve looked at all sorts of batter@@ ies that are made for cars , computers , cell phones , flash@@ lights , for anything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been using with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , and i found that all the batter@@ ies that we produce now could store less than 10 minutes of total energy . </s>
so we need a big break@@ through here , something that will be a factor of 100 better than the approach@@ es at the moment . </s>
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy . </s>
this is what happens when you try to bring these inter@@ rup@@ ted sources to say we &apos;re bringing 20 percent -- 30 percent of the budget . </s>
if you want to support 100 percent , you need an incredible wonder battery battery . </s>
now , where are we going to go , what &apos;s the right approach ? </s>
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the target ? </s>
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds . </s>
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people . </s>
in many , they will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good . </s>
i think , here in the ted group , there are many who are already engaged in this . </s>
bill gross has several companies , among other things called es@@ ol@@ ar , who have great solar ther@@ mal technologies . </s>
vin@@ die k@@ ho@@ s@@ la invest@@ ed in do@@ zens of companies who do great things and have interesting opportunities , and i try to support them . </s>
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i finance a company that might surprise , perhaps surprisingly , the nuclear approach . </s>
there are some innovation in nuclear space ; mod@@ ular , liquid . </s>
the evolution has stopped in this industry a few years ago , so it &apos;s no great surprise that some good concepts are around . </s>
the ter@@ ra@@ power@@ -@@ concept means that instead of a part of the ur@@ ani@@ ans , one percent , the u@@ 2@@ 35 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , which is u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . </s>
it &apos;s a pretty crazy idea . </s>
but in fact , you &apos;d have thought about this for a long time , but you could never simu@@ late whether it would work , but since there was modern super@@ computers , you can simu@@ late it and see that , yes , with the right material approach , it looks like it does work . </s>
and because you burn this 99 percent , the cost is a lot better . </s>
in fact , you burn the garbage , and you can even use the waste from today &apos;s re@@ actors as a vehicle . </s>
instead of breaking your head over , you just burn it . it &apos;s a wonderful thing . </s>
the ur@@ ani@@ um is used gradu@@ ally , a little bit like a cand@@ le . </s>
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of colum@@ n , often as a &quot; traveling wave re@@ actor . &quot; </s>
it really sol@@ ves the fuel problem . </s>
here &apos;s a picture of a place in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky . </s>
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that &apos;s bur@@ ned today , so it &apos;s called ur@@ ani@@ um ur@@ ani@@ um . </s>
the engine is the u.s. for hundreds of years . </s>
and if you make oce@@ an-@@ water low-@@ water , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet for the rest of the planet . </s>
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward . </s>
let &apos;s think about how to measure our success . </s>
what should we look like ? </s>
now , let &apos;s go to the target that we have to get to , and then we &apos;re going to talk about it . </s>
many speak of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . </s>
it &apos;s really very important that we get there . </s>
the other 20 percent will be created in poor countries , but still agriculture , and hopefully whale dro@@ po@@ ut and cement will be clean up until then . </s>
so to reach this 80 percent , the industrial states must have , including , countries like china , like china , their electricity generation . </s>
the other note is whether we &apos;re using zero emissions , whether it &apos;s in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest . </s>
that &apos;s extremely important . </s>
this is going to be a key element to this . </s>
if we go back from there , what should the 20@@ 20 show look like ? </s>
it should con@@ tain the two elements again . </s>
we should use effective activity to get re@@ duc@@ tions in the way . the less we em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze , the less the co2 will be the co2 , and the temperature will be the temperature . </s>
but in fact , this note of the things that we &apos;re doing not completely lead to the great re@@ wards , just in the same way , or even less important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for these break@@ through@@ s . </s>
we need these break@@ through@@ s to pur@@ sue full gas , and we can measure that : in corporate numbers , in pilot , in pilot projects and regu@@ lation changes . </s>
there are many great books to this topic . </s>
the al gore book , &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david m@@ ck@@ a@@ ys &apos;s &quot; sustainable energy use the hot air . &quot; </s>
they really go through it and create a frame in which this can be discus@@ sed , because we need support from all sides of all sides . </s>
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together . </s>
that &apos;s a wish . </s>
a very concrete wish for us to invent this technology . </s>
if you just gave me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i could love that , or i could choose that wish , which is half the energy cycle of co2 without co2 , and i could take that wish . </s>
this is the greatest impact . </s>
if we don &apos;t get this wish , it will be terrible between the long term and shor@@ t-@@ term people are terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of those 2 billion lives are going to be much worse . </s>
so what do we need to do ? </s>
for what meas@@ ures , i appe@@ al ? </s>
we need to use ourselves for more research fun@@ ds . </s>
when countries meet in places like cop@@ per hair , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 . </s>
you should have discus@@ sed this innovation strategy , and you &apos;d be sho@@ cked by the ridiculous fun@@ ds that are spent on these innovative approach@@ es . </s>
we need market ti@@ tles , co2 ta@@ xes , r &amp; amp ; trade stuff , that creates a price signal . </s>
we have to spread the message . </s>
we need to lead dialo@@ gue and complete dialo@@ gue , and also the things that are being done by the government . </s>
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can ful@@ fill it . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you . thank you ! </s>
thank you very much . just to understand ter@@ ra@@ power a little bit better -- first , can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment ? </s>
bill gates : to do the simulation on a super@@ computer , get all the great scientists that we &apos;ve done , we need only a few 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russi@@ an re@@ actor , to make sure it works sensi@@ bly , you &apos;re only in the 10@@ 0@@ 0s . </s>
the tri@@ cky step is building the first re@@ actor , finding another billion , the regul@@ ari@@ ans and the site that actually buil@@ ds the first of it . </s>
once the first finished is finished , when it goes like this , it &apos;s all clear , because the economy , the energy density , is just as different as we know about nuclear power , as we know it . </s>
in order to understand that , that means building deep into the soil almost like a vertical colum@@ n of nuclear fuel fuel , that used ur@@ ani@@ um , and then the process starts on top and further down ? </s>
b@@ g : right . now , you &apos;ve got to re@@ cover the re@@ actor forever , so there &apos;s lots of people and lots and lots of controls that can go wrong , this thing where you open it and get things out . that &apos;s not good ! </s>
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a pill@@ ar -- that bur@@ st you , without the whole comple@@ xi@@ ties . </s>
and it &apos;s sitting there and burn for 60 years , and then it &apos;s finished . </s>
a nuclear re@@ actor that allows itself to provide a solution to the garbage . </s>
b@@ g : yeah . now , what happens to the trash : you can let it sit -- there &apos;s a lot less waste out of that method -- then you take it and put it into the next re@@ actor and burn it . </s>
and we &apos;re starting by taking the waste that already exists in these re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators or dry fields in the re@@ actors . this is our fuel fuel . </s>
so this is what these re@@ actors are a problem , which is what we fill in , and it will dramatically reduce the waste volume during this process . </s>
but while they were talking to different people of the world about these possibilities . </s>
where is the greatest interest in really doing what &apos;s really going on ? </s>
b@@ g : now we haven &apos;t set up in a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting re@@ vel@@ ations for everything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s great interest , and the people of the company were in russia , india , china -- i was here and met the energy em@@ bas@@ sy and talked about how this fits to the energy agenda . </s>
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction . </s>
this is a version of one thing that was made . </s>
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster re@@ actor , and some countries have built this , so anybody who has done a quick re@@ actor , a candi@@ date for our first . </s>
in your mind , ti@@ me-@@ lap@@ se and probability that you really should call your life ? </s>
b@@ g : well we need one of these sc@@ al@@ able , gener@@ ous things that are very cheap , that we have 20 years to make and then use 20 years to use . </s>
this is kind of the dead@@ line that has shown us the environmental models that we need to bear in . </s>
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ power , if it &apos;s okay , and that &apos;s a big wish , could make it easy . </s>
and lu@@ ck@@ ily , there are do@@ zens of companies today , and we need hundreds that , as well as their approach@@ es , can work for their pil@@ ots to contribute to their pil@@ ots . </s>
and it would be best if we can do it multiple , because then you could use a mix@@ ture . </s>
anyway , we need a solution . </s>
does the big possible break@@ through@@ s break@@ through is this the biggest thing you know ? </s>
b@@ g : a energy break@@ through is the most important thing . </s>
it would have been without the environment , but it makes it so much more important . </s>
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies . </s>
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the mod@@ ular method , which is a different approach . </s>
there &apos;s a liquid re@@ actor which seems a little bit difficult , but maybe the ones that tell us about it . </s>
and so there are different , but the beauty of it is that a pri@@ or molecule has a million times as much energy as one , say , a coal molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and those are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in a own lea@@ gue . </s>
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ? </s>
do we have to hire emergency meas@@ ures to try to keep the world temperature stable ? </s>
b@@ g : so when you get to that situation , it &apos;s like eating too much , and just in front of a heart attack , what do you do ? you might need a heart attack or something . </s>
there &apos;s a research that &apos;s called geo@@ engineering , which involves various techniques to del@@ ay warming , so that we &apos;ve got 20 or 30 years longer to get us together . </s>
that &apos;s just a insurance method . </s>
you hope we don &apos;t need this . </s>
some people say that you shouldn &apos;t work on insurance because you might be la@@ zy , so you keep eating , because you know that you &apos;re going to save heart surgery . </s>
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you &apos;re importance to the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a dis@@ course in geo@@ engineering about whether you should have this available , if things get faster , or that innovation takes longer than we expect . </s>
climate mas@@ k : do you have one or two sent@@ ences for you to convince you ? </s>
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tics live in very different cam@@ ps . </s>
those who make scientific arguments are very little . </s>
do you say there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that change things ? </s>
there are very , very few things you can even tell , from which there is a chance in a million . </s>
the main problem here is similar to aids . </s>
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later . </s>
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of ur@@ gent problems to invest in something that you have only later -- and to get the investment not so clear , in fact , i@@ p@@ c@@ c report doesn &apos;t necessarily report the worst scen@@ ario , and there are people in the rich world who look at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big dra@@ ma . </s>
the fact is that this un@@ certainty should worry . </s>
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time you can get the co2 apart , then the skep@@ tics say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested that it doesn &apos;t em@@ pa@@ thi@@ ze , i wish it almost did , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot; </s>
and that would be your answer to the b@@ j@@ en l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument that if you take all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffer from poverty , the poverty reduction , the fighting of malaria and so on , it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest money , while there are better things that we can do . </s>
b@@ g : well , the actual spending on research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than you do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic . </s>
below other things , other things shouldn &apos;t suffer . </s>
you &apos;re going to get too big money , and there are reas@@ onable people here when you &apos;re having something that &apos;s not econom@@ ically economic , and trying to finance that . for me , most of the waste is happening here . </s>
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short before a free break@@ through and just funded the learning curve , i think we should try to do more things that are going to have the potential to be much less expensive . </s>
if the inter@@ ior you get , you get a very high price of energy , then only the rich one can keep up . </s>
i mean , each one of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing its lifestyle . </s>
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster . </s>
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g is thinking . </s>
and he &apos;s a new belie@@ ver , &quot; why don &apos;t you talk about that anymore ? &quot; </s>
it &apos;s still being associated because of his earlier stories associated with the skep@@ tic@@ ism camp , but he understood that this is a very lon@@ ely group , and that &apos;s why he takes the research argument now . </s>
and that &apos;s a thought that i think is appropriate for appropriate power . </s>
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little people get suppor@@ ted . </s>
bill , i think i speak for almost every person here when i say , i really hope that your wish will be true . thank you very much . </s>
b@@ g : thank you . </s>
a few years ago , at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man asked a design competition called &quot; the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge . &quot; </s>
the idea is pretty simple . four teams have to have to build the largest possible structure with 20 spaghe@@ tt@@ i , about three feet of tape , about three feet and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low . </s>
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low needs to be on top of it . </s>
and even though it seems really easy , it &apos;s actually quite difficult because it really ur@@ ges people to work together very quickly . </s>
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i transformed it into a design work@@ shop . </s>
it was a huge success . </s>
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 work@@ shops worldwide , with students , develop@@ ers and architects , even with c@@ tos of fortune 50-@@ company , and there &apos;s something about this task , which allows deep sen@@ sations into the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with you . </s>
usually , most people start ori@@ enting themselves to the task . </s>
you talk about what it will look like , what it will look like , it sp@@ ins around . </s>
then you invest a little bit of time in planning and organization , and you sket@@ ch and kill spaghe@@ tt@@ i . </s>
they invest most of their time in the co@@ verage of growing structures . </s>
and finally , just before they don &apos;t have time , someone takes the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they put it on the top , step back and &quot; ta@@ -@@ da ! &quot; they admi@@ re their work . </s>
but then , almost always , the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; is going to be a &quot; u@@ h oh , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low causes the whole thing to dis@@ agree and dis@@ rupt . </s>
there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and under the worst are fresh b@@ w@@ l lar@@ va@@ e . </s>
they lie , they &apos;re che@@ ating , they &apos;re conf@@ used and they &apos;re really dr@@ ought . </s>
and of course , there are also teams who have much more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da , &quot; and among the best are fresh growth of kinder@@ garten . </s>
and this is quite amazing . </s>
as peter told us , they produce not just the highest to@@ wers , but the most interesting structures of all . </s>
what you might be asking is , how does that happen ? why ? what about those ? </s>
and peter tells me , &quot; none of the kids spend time in the head of spaghe@@ tt@@ i g@@ m@@ b@@ h . &quot; </s>
they don &apos;t invest in powerful fighting fi@@ ghts . </s>
but there is another reason . </s>
and that is that b@@ w@@ l students have been trained to find a real plan , ok ? </s>
and then to realize it . </s>
what happens when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they don &apos;t have time and what happens ? </s>
it &apos;s a crisis . </s>
sound familiar , what ? </s>
what kinder@@ garten kids do is they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and build prototyp@@ es , successful prototyp@@ es , always with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low at the top , so that they have several times the chance of fix@@ ing prototyp@@ ing prototyp@@ es . </s>
con@@ struc@@ tion@@ ists are disco@@ vering this kind of collaboration as an i@@ ter@@ ative process . </s>
and with every trial , the children get immedi@@ ate feedback from what works and what doesn &apos;t . </s>
so the power to work with prototyp@@ es , a lot -- but let &apos;s see how different teams are operating . </s>
the average for most is about 50 inches in b@@ w@@ l , b@@ w@@ l students get half of them , but not much , children &apos;s children are better than adults . </s>
who is most successful ? </s>
architects and engineers , for happiness . </s>
t@@ m : the highest thing i &apos;ve seen . </s>
and why ? because they understand tri@@ an@@ gles and safe self-@@ am@@ pli@@ fied ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric patterns are the key to build stable structures . </s>
ce@@ os are a little bit on average . but this is where it gets interesting . </s>
if you put an ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ al admini@@ str@@ ator on the team , they &apos;re signific@@ antly better . </s>
it &apos;s amazing . you look around and you see , &quot; this team is going to win . &quot; </s>
you can predict the future . why is that ? </s>
because they have special skills for processing compan@@ i@@ ons . </s>
they lead the process , they understand it . </s>
and that team that regul@@ ates and regar@@ ds to work will signific@@ antly improve the performance of the team . </s>
speci@@ alized skills and process@@ ors and their combination lead lead to success . </s>
if you have 10 teams who are typical , you get about six that have stable structures . </s>
now i was trying to do something interesting . </s>
i thought we &apos;d bring the po@@ ckets in the same way . </s>
so i offered a $ 10,000 prize for the w@@ inner for the w@@ inner . </s>
what do you think happened to these design students ? </s>
what was the result ? </s>
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure . </s>
if anybody had built a two-@@ inch con@@ struc@@ tion , he would have carried the prize home . </s>
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competi@@ tions have a strong effect ? </s>
we repe@@ ated this exercise with the same students . </s>
what do you think happened now ? </s>
now they understood the benefit of prototyp@@ ing . </s>
so for the same , bad team has been under the best . </s>
they produced the highest construction in the least time . </s>
so there are profound lessons for us , nature &apos;s nature and success and success . </s>
and you might ask , why would someone actually invest a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge to create a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ? </s>
and the reason is , i help digital tools and processes to help team teams , cars , video games and visual services . </s>
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge is , it helps to identify you hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions . </s>
because frankly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low . </s>
the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language , a de@@ fault , to build the right prototype . </s>
and this is the value of that experience , this simple exercise . </s>
and those of you that are interested in can visit mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ ge@@ .com . </s>
it &apos;s a blog where you see the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low building . </s>
there &apos;s a ste@@ p-@@ by-@@ step instru@@ ction there . </s>
you can find crazy examples from all over the world , how people are optimi@@ zing and re@@ fin@@ ing the system . </s>
there are also world record . </s>
and the bas@@ ale lesson , i think , is that construction is actually a commitment sport . </s>
it requires that we all focus on the task of the task and that we use our thinking opti@@ mal , how our feelings and our actions are in the challenge that we face . </s>
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all what it takes to bring us from a &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; -- to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment . </s>
and that can make a big difference . </s>
thank you . </s>
let &apos;s pre@@ tend we have a machine here . </s>
a big machine , a cool , ted machine , and this is a time machine . </s>
and everybody in this room has to be in there . </s>
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay here and now . </s>
and i wonder what they would choose because i asked my friends in the last day often , and they wanted to go to the past . </s>
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or &quot; america &apos;s super@@ star . &quot; </s>
i don &apos;t know . </s>
i &apos;m convinced that somehow you &apos;re drawn to the no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , you &apos;re drawn to wonder . </s>
and i understand that . </s>
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say . </s>
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an ad@@ vent@@ er . </s>
it &apos;s because possibilities don &apos;t go back on this planet ; they go forward . </s>
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future . </s>
this is the greatest time that ever existed on this planet , regar@@ d@@ less of what causes them : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , opportunities , sin@@ king disease . </s>
we &apos;ve never had a time like this before . </s>
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents died when they were 60 . </s>
my grand@@ parents placed this number at 7@@ 0@@ th . </s>
my parents are the 80 / 80 . </s>
so there should be better at the beginning of my death row . </s>
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that . </s>
a child who &apos;s born in new delhi today can be expected to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world 100 years ago . </s>
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact . </s>
and why is that ? </s>
the smallpox . the smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet . </s>
they &apos;ve re@@ formed the demo@@ graphics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done . </s>
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone . </s>
we hi@@ red them . pu@@ ff . </s>
in the rich world there are diseases that millions of us have still threat@@ ened with only one generation , barely even more . </s>
di@@ ph@@ el , tube , child paraly@@ sis ... </s>
does anybody know what this is ? </s>
vaccin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are the success@@ es of the scientific method . </s>
and from my perspective , the scientific method is trying to test things , see whether it works , if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achie@@ v@@ ements of humanity . </s>
so that &apos;s the good news . </s>
unfortunately , it &apos;s all good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned quite a lot . </s>
and one of them is that despite all of our achie@@ v@@ ements , a billion people in this world are going to bed hungry for every day . </s>
that number goes up , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embarras@@ sing . </s>
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to deva@@ station this world th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly . </s>
drinking water , ancient land , rain@@ forests , oil , gas -- they &apos;re disappe@@ aring , and if we don &apos;t , and if we don &apos;t innov@@ ate out of that chaos , we &apos;re going to disappear . </s>
so the question is , can we do that ? i think so . </s>
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without ra@@ ping the country they live in . </s>
i think we can power this world with energy that it doesn &apos;t destroy at the same time . </s>
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a wonder . </s>
but this is what keeps me a@@ wake at night -- one of the things that keeps me a@@ wake at night , and we &apos;ve never used scientific progress as bad@@ ly as now , never . </s>
and we &apos;ve never been able to use it sensi@@ bly , just like we can now . </s>
we &apos;re at the thres@@ hold of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think that we would have to go back hundreds and 300 years before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time where we &apos;ve f@@ ought progress , where we &apos;ve been driving over these things over these things , more than now . </s>
people are sha@@ king in their faith , and it &apos;s so close that you can &apos;t free them . </s>
not even the truth will free them . </s>
and listen , everyone has a right to their opinion , even a true one to his opinion about progress . </s>
but do you know what they don &apos;t have right ? </s>
they don &apos;t have any right to their own facts . &apos; sorry , they don &apos;t have them . </s>
and i took a while to figure that out . </s>
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about &quot; the new yorker &quot; for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article . </s>
and i was ama@@ zed to be resi@@ stant to resistance , resistance to the end , which is the most effective measure in health care in the history of humanity . </s>
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always did , i wrote an article and i went on . </s>
and i soon wrote an article about gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food . </s>
the same thing , only bigger . </s>
people were playing crazy . </s>
so , i wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought it was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ -@@ food &quot; , why they believed that molecules in a particular way was an accident trans@@ mission to the area of nature . </s>
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept going . </s>
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist . </s>
we type , we &apos;re rich , we eat , that &apos;s okay . </s>
but these papers made me worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found it . </s>
and that &apos;s because these fan@@ a@@ tics , which made me crazy , were not making any fan@@ a@@ tics at all . </s>
these were in@@ san@@ e people , trained people , de@@ cent people . </s>
they were just like the people in this room . </s>
and that got me through ... </s>
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest . </s>
we &apos;ve come to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to . </s>
we &apos;re talking about t@@ ari@@ zing . </s>
we talk ir@@ onic about it , with little execu@@ tives of it , &quot; progress . &quot; </s>
okay , so there are reasons , and i think we know what these reasons are . </s>
we have trust in institutions , in authority , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way . </s>
you can just call a few names , and people will understand . </s>
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ o@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ ox@@ x , weapons of mass destruction , the u.s. pres@@ identi@@ al election . </s>
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list . </s>
there are questions and problems with the people that we thought they would always be right . so be skep@@ tical . </s>
ask questions , ask the evidence of evidence , demand it . </s>
don &apos;t take anything for granted . </s>
but here &apos;s what happens : if you get evidence you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it . </s>
and i can say that , for the reason , we live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen before , and hopefully never see it again . </s>
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a horrible story that brought the very muscle epidemic with the mas@@ k , mu@@ mp@@ s and roman vaccine vaccine . </s>
very scary . </s>
h@@ ence studies have been done to see if that &apos;s true . </s>
h@@ ence studies have to be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue . </s>
the data came in . </s>
the data came from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no cor@@ relation , no connection , no connection . </s>
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in an@@ ec@@ dot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we believe we believe that we feel really real . </s>
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of docum@@ ents of a government that is giving us data , and i understand that , i think we all do that . </s>
but you know what ? </s>
the result of this was catastrop@@ hi@@ c . </s>
catastrop@@ hi@@ c of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where vaccin@@ es dec@@ lar@@ ed for mas@@ ses . </s>
that &apos;s sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous and we should be ash@@ amed . </s>
it &apos;s awful . </s>
what has happened is that we &apos;ve been able to do that . </s>
well , i understand that . i do . </s>
because does anybody have mas@@ ks here ? </s>
has one single one in the audience ever watching anyone on mas@@ ks ? </s>
it doesn &apos;t happen very often . </s>
it doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but 16@@ 0,000 times in the last year . </s>
this is a lot of deaths from mas@@ ses , 20 per hour . </s>
but because this didn &apos;t happen here , we can ur@@ ge it , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can run around and messages about fear and il@@ liter@@ acy of plat@@ forms like op@@ ra@@ h and larry king live . </s>
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and cor@@ relation . </s>
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same . </s>
and this is something that we have to learn , very quickly . </s>
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k . </s>
he was liber@@ ating us from one of the worst sho@@ ots of humanity . </s>
no fear , no qu@@ ity , kinder@@ garten , pu@@ ff , gone . </s>
the guy in the center not so much . </s>
it &apos;s called paul off@@ it . </s>
he &apos;s just developed a couple of people with a ro@@ ta@@ viral vaccine right now . </s>
he can save the lives of 4@@ 00@@ - to save 50@@ 0,000 children a year in the developing world . </s>
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ? </s>
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul is walking around and talking about vaccin@@ es and saying how valuable they are , and that people should just stop wor@@ rying . </s>
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s actually saying . </s>
so paul is a terror@@ ist . </s>
when paul talks in a public audience , he can &apos;t say without ar@@ med gu@@ ards . </s>
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that you know where your kids are going to school . </s>
and why ? because paul made a vaccine . </s>
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccin@@ es are essential . </s>
if you take them forward , the diseases go back , horrible diseases , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening . </s>
we now have mas@@ ks in this country . </s>
and that gets worse , and pretty soon children will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers . </s>
and they &apos;re not just going to die in mas@@ ses . </s>
what about child paraly@@ sis ? let &apos;s do it . why not ? </s>
a com@@ pound of mine wrote me a few weeks ago , and i said to her , i think i &apos;m a bit of a shrimp . </s>
no one &apos;s ever told them that before . </s>
she wouldn &apos;t vaccin@@ ate her child against child paraly@@ sis . absolutely not . </s>
f@@ ence . </s>
why ? because we don &apos;t have a child &apos;s paraly@@ sis , and you know what ? </s>
we didn &apos;t have a child paraly@@ sis in this country yesterday . </s>
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody in la@@ gos was going to la@@ gos this morning , and he &apos;s going to los angeles , and he &apos;s los angeles , right now , at the moment of o@@ hi@@ o . </s>
and in a couple of hours he goes and he r@@ ings a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastic ted dinner tonight . </s>
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paraly@@ zed illness , and we don &apos;t know that either , because that &apos;s how the world works . </s>
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t feel like it &apos;s not . </s>
we love to cover ourselves in lies . we love that . </s>
did you take all your vitam@@ ins this morning ? </s>
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a small anti@@ o@@ xi@@ dan@@ ti@@ um that helps them do the jum@@ ping . </s>
i know they did that because half the americans are doing it every day . </s>
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference how often we find out that they &apos;re us@@ eless . </s>
the data shows it all the time . </s>
they ev@@ apo@@ rate their ur@@ ine , and they almost never do . </s>
that &apos;s okay , you &apos;d like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ani@@ um . </s>
i agree with them all . </s>
dark ur@@ ine . dark . </s>
why are we doing this ? why are we doing this ? </s>
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharma@@ ceu@@ tical industry . </s>
we hate a strong government . we have no trust in the system . </s>
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care system is mies . </s>
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people . </s>
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating to us that can afford it . </s>
so , we walk away from that , and where are we going ? </s>
we &apos;re running into the arms of plac@@ e@@ bo industry . </s>
that &apos;s great . i love the plac@@ e@@ bo industry . </s>
but , you know , it &apos;s a serious business , because the stuff is cra@@ p , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it . </s>
and i have all kinds of little pro@@ ps here . </s>
none of them -- g@@ ing@@ ko , wor@@ n , e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , che@@ ating , ac@@ ai , i don &apos;t even know what this is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it , it &apos;s frau@@ d . </s>
and you know what ? when i say that , people y@@ ell at me and say , &quot; what do you care about ? let &apos;s do whatever you want . </s>
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot; </s>
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong . </s>
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the health minister who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to accept the evidence of my experts in mammo@@ graphy , &quot; or any can@@ cers , who are going to treat their patients with ca@@ ff@@ les . &quot; </s>
if you give yourself to this way where belief and magic and science and science replace you , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be . </s>
they get to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa . </s>
he brought 40@@ 0,000 of his people around because he insi@@ sted that red bee@@ es , po@@ ts and le@@ mon oil are much more effective than anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs that we know can bra@@ ve the course of aids . </s>
hundreds of thousands of thousands of deaths in a country that are worse than any other of that disease will be em@@ it@@ ted . </s>
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences . </s>
they have them . they always have . </s>
now , the most knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ able epidemic in which we &apos;re right now is this absur@@ d struggle between the gene@@ tically modi@@ fied food and the bio-@@ elite . </s>
that &apos;s an i@@ dio@@ tic debate . she has to stop . </s>
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors . </s>
this is ide@@ ology , not science . </s>
everything that we eat , every rice sk@@ it , every bran@@ ch of pe@@ an@@ sil@@ a , every ro@@ se@@ chef , has been changed by the people . </s>
you know , there were no mand@@ ar@@ ines in par@@ ad@@ ise . </s>
there were no can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe@@ -@@ mel@@ ons . </s>
there was no christmas tree . we did all this . </s>
we &apos;ve done it over the last 1@@ 1,000 years . </s>
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t work . </s>
we went out , which didn &apos;t work . </s>
now we can make it more closely . and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitam@@ in a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , increase their lives . </s>
you don &apos;t want to do that ? </s>
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand . </s>
we &apos;re extra@@ cting gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food . </s>
why do we do that ? </s>
well , what i &apos;m always hearing is too many chemicals , pesti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , hor@@ mon@@ es , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong . </s>
we don &apos;t want companies to live lives . </s>
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds . </s>
and you know what my answer to all of this is ? </s>
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that . </s>
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science . </s>
that has nothing to do with science . </s>
it &apos;s right , morality , patent stuff . </s>
you know , science is not a company . </s>
it &apos;s not a country . </s>
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process . </s>
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re scared of it , and it &apos;s holding millions of people from the fl@@ our@@ ishing . </s>
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;ll have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent . </s>
this investment in africa over the last 30 years . </s>
embarras@@ sing . sh@@ am@@ eful . </s>
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them . </s>
and why ? genetic engineering changed food . </s>
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this cont@@ amin@@ ated stuff , like mani@@ fest@@ o , for example . </s>
mani@@ o@@ c is something that eat half a billion people . </s>
it &apos;s just like a po@@ ta@@ to . </s>
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it &apos;s mies . </s>
it has no nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists do all this stuff in it . </s>
and then people could eat that and would not be blin@@ ded . </s>
you wouldn &apos;t be star@@ ving , and you know what ? </s>
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice . </s>
and all i can say to that is , why do we fight it ? </s>
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why are we fighting this ? </s>
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ? </s>
it &apos;s not about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals . </s>
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our in@@ genu@@ ity at greater food , better food , unique food . </s>
it &apos;s not about rice crisis ; it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time for understanding what that means . </s>
because you know what ? </s>
if we don &apos;t do that , as we go forward as far as we do so far , i think i &apos;m not guil@@ ty of being guil@@ ty , i believe , high-@@ tech coloni@@ alism . </s>
there &apos;s no other descri@@ ption of what &apos;s going on here . </s>
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our worthy , and we really need to stop it . </s>
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you still want to go to this ridiculous time machine and go into the future ? &quot; </s>
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do . </s>
at the moment , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity . </s>
we can put this time machine on everything we want . </s>
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;ll move them where we want to . </s>
we have to have these conversations , and we have to think , but when we go to the time machine and we &apos;ll go into the future , we &apos;ll be happy to have done that . </s>
i know we can do it , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , it &apos;s something that the world needs now . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you . </s>
so for a while , i &apos;ve been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , and it might seem strange that a magi@@ cian is interested in it , unless you look at it as me , as &quot; a de@@ ception , which is something that someone belie@@ ves when someone belie@@ ves in it . &quot; </s>
in other words , sugar p@@ ills have shown a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in some studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , and it &apos;s just because the person thinks what &apos;s happening to you is a pharma@@ ceu@@ tical or a kind of -- in pain management , for example , when the patient only belie@@ ves enough enough of it , a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body you call the plac@@ e@@ bo effect . </s>
it &apos;s a de@@ cent del@@ ay because somebody percei@@ ves it . </s>
so that we also understand each other , and now i want to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick . </s>
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that at least since the 195@@ 0s was in every magic book for children . </s>
i learned it from the cu@@ b sc@@ out magic in the 197@@ 0s in the 197@@ 0s . </s>
i &apos;m going to take it for you and explain it . </s>
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it . </s>
so , look what happens . </s>
the kni@@ fe that you &apos;re able to look at , my hand , that you can study . </s>
i &apos;m just going to keep the kni@@ fe in my la@@ dder . </s>
i bl@@ ame my sle@@ eve . </s>
and to make sure that nothing disappe@@ ars in my sle@@ eve or out of it , i &apos;m just going to put my wr@@ ist right here . </s>
in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time at any time , and as long as i &apos;m watching this , nothing can go to my sle@@ eve or get out of my sle@@ eve . </s>
and the goal here is very simple . </s>
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully when everything goes well , the kni@@ fe will be held by my m@@ ere physical magne@@ tis@@ m . </s>
it &apos;s actually so solid in its place that i can shake it without dro@@ pping the kni@@ fe down . </s>
nothing goes in my sle@@ eve or comes out , doesn &apos;t anima@@ te , and you can see everything . </s>
ta@@ -@@ do@@ h ! </s>
now , this is a trick that i often teach young children who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about de@@ ception when you look closer , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick . </s>
probably many of you in the room will know this trick . </s>
so he works like this . </s>
i hold the kni@@ fe in my hand . </s>
i &apos;m saying that i &apos;m killing my wr@@ ist to make sure that there &apos;s nothing in my sle@@ eve or out , and that &apos;s a lie . </s>
the reason why i &apos;m holding my wr@@ ist is that the real secret of illusion is there . </s>
at the moment , where i take my hand away from you , so you can see it from behind , this finger moves here , my finger finger , just where it was , where it was , in a position where it &apos;s so stre@@ t@@ ched . </s>
great trick ? </s>
there is someone in the back who has no childhood . </s>
well , it &apos;s here . right . </s>
and when i turn around , the fingers changes its position . </s>
and now you could talk about why this is a de@@ ception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t matter -- one , two , three , but it sees it as a group . </s>
but that &apos;s not really what &apos;s going on here , and then i open my hand . </s>
of course , it &apos;s main@@ ta@@ ined , but not by the magne@@ tis@@ m of my body , but through a trick , through my finger , which is there . </s>
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens when i turn back through this movement , that the fingers will move back . </s>
i take that hand away . and here is the kni@@ fe . </s>
this trick can lead you to your friends and neighbors . thank you . </s>
now , what does this have to do with plac@@ e@@ bo effect ? </s>
a year ago or so , i read a study that really ble@@ w my mind . </s>
i &apos;m not a doctor or a scientist , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing to me . </s>
and it turned out , if you offer a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white ball , in the form of an as@@ pi@@ rate tab@@ let , it &apos;s just a round , white p@@ ill that has a particular meas@@ ur@@ able effect . </s>
but if you give the shape where you give the plac@@ e@@ bo , for example , in a smaller p@@ ill , for example , and those blue color and a letter on it , it &apos;s actually meas@@ ur@@ able more effective . </s>
and that , although none of those pharma@@ ceu@@ tical -- it &apos;s just sugar p@@ ills . </s>
but a white mush@@ room is not as good as a blue p@@ ill . </s>
what ? it really fre@@ ak@@ ed me out . </s>
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all yet . </s>
when you get cap@@ su@@ le , they are more effective than tab@@ lets of any form . </s>
a color@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le that &apos;s on a end of yellow , and in the other red , is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le . </s>
also the do@@ sage plays a role . </s>
a p@@ ill twice is not as good as three p@@ ills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics now . i &apos;m sorry . </s>
but the key thing is , ... </s>
... that do@@ ses play a role too . </s>
and the shape plays a role . </s>
and if you want to have the ultimate plac@@ e@@ bo effect , you have to grab the need@@ le . </s>
right ? a sy@@ r@@ inge with an in@@ ert -- a few milli@@ on-@@ gall@@ ons of an effective sub@@ stance that you inje@@ ct to a patient . </s>
this creates a very powerful picture in the head , which is a lot stronger than a white p@@ ill . </s>
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a proje@@ ctor . </s>
so the fact is , the white p@@ ill does not work as well as the blue p@@ ill that doesn &apos;t seem as good as a cap@@ su@@ le that doesn &apos;t seem as good as the need@@ le . </s>
and none of it has any really pharma@@ ceu@@ tical tra@@ it , and it &apos;s only our belief that has a stronger impact on us . </s>
i wanted to know if i could use this idea of a magic trick . </s>
i take something that &apos;s obviously a de@@ ception , obviously , and make it look real . </s>
so we know from this study that you have to grab the need@@ le if it &apos;s to go to the need@@ le . </s>
this is an 18@@ -@@ inch hu@@ b . it &apos;s very , very ni@@ c@@ ely , and i &apos;m going to ster@@ ili@@ ze you first a little bit . </s>
this is actually my meat . it &apos;s not dam@@ n specific meat meat . </s>
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood . </s>
so i &apos;m going to stick this need@@ le in my skin and push it through it until she inter@@ rup@@ ted on the other side . </s>
if you &apos;re going to be wrong -- if you drop in your ear -- i &apos;ve done this a few friends in the hotel in the hotel room last night , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman has almost become a woman . </s>
so i &apos;m suggest@@ ing that if you go fast , you &apos;re going to look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first hot part back here . </s>
you can see it in a second , but you can also take away if you want . </s>
so , it goes like this , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little st@@ ack . </s>
i &apos;m so sorry . do you make it crazy ? </s>
and now just a little bit through my skin and then on the other side like this . </s>
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had at the kni@@ fe trick . </s>
something . </s>
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ? </s>
so , i &apos;ll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five . </s>
well , yeah . </s>
i know what people think when you see this . </s>
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not so stupid , it &apos;s not so stupid , it &apos;s the skin , just for us to stop for a few minutes . &quot; </s>
well , then i &apos;ll show it to you . </s>
what does this look like ? pretty good . </s>
yeah , i know . </s>
and the people in the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot; </s>
the people in the side rooms are coming in now . </s>
so let me show you the clo@@ s@@ est . </s>
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood . </s>
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn that around . </s>
i &apos;m sorry . if you get wrong , look away , don &apos;t look at it . </s>
the people in the back , or the ones who are later on video , say , &quot; well , it looks pretty impres@@ sive , but if it were real , it would -- you see , there &apos;s a hole here , and there , if it were real , it would be ble@@ eding it . &quot; </s>
okay , let me squ@@ ee@@ ze a little bit of blood for you . </s>
yes , there it is . </s>
usually i would take the need@@ le now . </s>
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no les@@ i@@ ons . </s>
but i think , in this context here , and with the inten@@ tion of making something real real , i &apos;m going to just leave the need@@ le in there and go off to the stage of the stage . </s>
we &apos;ll meet just a few times in the next few days . </s>
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . thank you very much . </s>
everyone is talking about happiness today . </s>
i &apos;ve coun@@ ted some people the number of books that have been published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they give up after about 40 , and there &apos;s a lot more . </s>
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness among researchers . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of happy co@@ ach@@ ing . </s>
everybody would like to make people happier . </s>
but despite all this f@@ loo@@ ding , there are multiple cognitive tra@@ its that make it almost impossible to think about happiness . </s>
and my talk today is going to be mainly by these cognitive fa@@ i@@ ths . </s>
and this is true for la@@ ying your own happiness about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just like everybody else &apos;s . </s>
the first of these falls is to admit complexity , complexity , complexity . </s>
it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word , because we apply it to too many different things . </s>
i think there &apos;s a certain signifi@@ can@@ ce that we can constra@@ in , but in large , all the things we need to be giving up , and we &apos;re going to take the complicated view of what &apos;s well-being . </s>
the second tra@@ p is a change of experience and memory : basically , you &apos;re happy between being happy in your life and being happy about your life or happy with your life . </s>
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both together in the idea of happiness . </s>
and the third is the concent@@ ration illusion , and this is the un@@ fortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affec@@ ts well-being without di@@ stor@@ ting its meaning . </s>
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p . </s>
there &apos;s just no way to get it right . </s>
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question answer session after one of my lec@@ tures that told a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he had heard a symph@@ ony , and it was absolutely glori@@ ous music , and at the end of the recording , there was a terrible ch@@ unk of sound . </s>
and then he added , really , pretty emotional , that ru@@ ined all the experience . </s>
but it didn &apos;t . </s>
what it ru@@ ined was the memories of the experience . </s>
he had had the experience . </s>
he &apos;d had 20 minutes of total music . </s>
they didn &apos;t count because he was fa@@ ther@@ ed with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all he had to keep . </s>
what really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self . </s>
there is a living self that lives in the present and knows the present , is able to experience the past , but basically have the present . </s>
it &apos;s the living self that the doctor represents -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt if i put it up here ? &quot; </s>
and then there &apos;s a memory self , and the memory itself is that coun@@ ting coun@@ t@@ less and the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the doctor who calls the question by asking the question , &quot; how have you felt l@@ ately ? &quot; </s>
or , &quot; what was your journey to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something like that . </s>
these are two very different units , the living self and the memory self , and conf@@ using the two of the two is part of the concept of happiness . </s>
well , the memory self is a story@@ teller . </s>
and that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts inst@@ antly . </s>
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re doing stories to tell stories . </s>
our memory tells us stories , which is what we must keep from our experiences , is a story . </s>
and let &apos;s start with an example . </s>
there &apos;s an old study . </s>
these are real patients under@@ going a painful proce@@ d@@ ure . </s>
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful when this trial was done in the 1990s . </s>
they were asked to report every 60 seconds of their pain . </s>
and here are two patients . these are your record . </s>
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of you guys have suff@@ ered more ? &quot; </s>
and that &apos;s a very simple question . </s>
patient b clearly suff@@ ered more . his gut refle@@ ction was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a had had patient b , and more . </s>
but now there &apos;s another question , &quot; how much did these patients think they were suffering ? &quot; </s>
and here &apos;s a surprise . </s>
and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the ju@@ ven@@ ile refle@@ ction as a patient . </s>
the stories of repres@@ entation were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends . </s>
and none of these stories are very gener@@ ous , or great -- but one of them is that clear . </s>
but one of them is much worse than the other . </s>
and the one that was worse was where the pain was at its end at the end of its peak , it &apos;s a bad story . </s>
how do we know that ? </s>
because we asked these people after their gut refle@@ ction , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot; </s>
and she was much worse for a than for b in memory . </s>
now , this is a direct conflict between the survi@@ ving self and the memory self . </s>
from the point of view of the living self , b clearly had a worse time . </s>
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical trial , and it was done , and it works , you know , you could actually ex@@ tend the repres@@ entation of patient a by simply letting the ho@@ ok in there without getting too much on it . </s>
that will lead to the patient suffering , but only a little bit and much less than before . </s>
and if you do this for a couple of minutes , you can imagine that the survi@@ vor@@ s of patient a bad thing is worse , and you know , you know that the memory of patient a is much better , because now you &apos;ve given patient a better story about it . </s>
what does a story look like ? </s>
and this is true of the stories that memory us , and it &apos;s true for the stories we invent . </s>
so what a story is that a story is out@@ break , significant moments and end . </s>
end is very , very important , and in this case the end domin@@ ated the end . </s>
well , the survi@@ vor itself lives his life continu@@ ously . </s>
it has moments of life , one after another . </s>
and you &apos;re asking , what happens to these moments ? </s>
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever . </s>
i mean , most of the moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve looked at this -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds long , which means that in a lifetime , there are about 600 million of them . in a month there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 . most of them won &apos;t leave behind . </s>
most of them are completely ignor@@ ed by the remember@@ ed self . </s>
and yet , somehow you get the idea that you should count , that what happens during those moments of life is our life . </s>
it &apos;s the limited resource that we consume while we are in the world . </s>
and how we consume it would seem important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the memory itself of us . </s>
so we have the memory self and the survi@@ vor@@ s itself , and they &apos;re really quite different . </s>
the biggest difference between them is time with time . </s>
from the point of view of the living self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is exactly as good as the first , the second vac@@ uum vac@@ ation is twice as good as the current vac@@ ation . </s>
that &apos;s not how it works at all , at all . </s>
for the memory self , a two-@@ hour vac@@ ation is almost better than the current vac@@ uum vac@@ ation , because there &apos;s no new memories to be added . </s>
they didn &apos;t change the story . </s>
and in this way , time is the critical vari@@ able that is different from an empty self from a living self , and time has very little impact on this story . </s>
well , the memory itself makes itself more than to remember and tell stories . </s>
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , who had a patient refle@@ ction in two different surge@@ ons and deci@@ des what it &apos;s going to pick up , is that the net who has the memory is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be selec@@ ted . </s>
the survi@@ ving self doesn &apos;t have a voice of choice . </s>
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experiences . we choose between memories of experiences . </s>
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t normally think of our future as experiences . </s>
we think of our future as a predi@@ cted memories . </s>
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of memory itself , and you can think of the memory itself as one that sort of takes the living itself through through experiences that didn &apos;t need the living itself . </s>
i have the impres@@ sion that if we &apos;re doing vac@@ ations that &apos;s very often the case , that means we &apos;re making vac@@ ations largely at the services of the remember@@ ing themselves . </s>
and it &apos;s a little hard to justi@@ fy , i think . </s>
i mean , how do we honor from our memories of our memories ? </s>
this is one of the explan@@ ations that &apos;s given to the domin@@ ance of memory itself . </s>
and when i think about it , i think of a vac@@ ation that we did a few years ago in ant@@ arc@@ tica , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think quite often in relation to how often i think about other vac@@ ations . </s>
and i &apos;ve probably been from my memories to this three-@@ stro@@ ke journey , and i &apos;d say about 25 minutes in the last four minutes in the last four minutes . </s>
now , if i ever opened the fol@@ der to the 600 images of this , i would have spent another hour . </s>
well , this is three weeks , and that &apos;s about a year and a half . </s>
there seems to be a dis@@ agre@@ ement . </s>
now , i may be a little bit extreme , you know , how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have on the memories of memories , but even if you &apos;re doing more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight to the weight that we experience ? </s>
so i want you to think about an thought experiment . </s>
imagine your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation , all your images will be wi@@ ped out , and you get a am@@ nes@@ i@@ c drug , so you won &apos;t remember anything . </s>
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ? </s>
and if you would choose another vac@@ ation , there is a conflict between your two types of self , and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and it &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think in the sense of time you get an answer , and if you think in the sense of memories , you might get a different answer . </s>
why we choose the vac@@ ation that we choose is a problem we have with a choice between the two types of self . </s>
well , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness . </s>
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self . </s>
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ? </s>
and then you &apos;d ask : how happy are the moments in the lives of the living self ? </s>
and they &apos;re all -- happiness in the eye is a rather complicated process . </s>
what are the emotions that can be measured ? </s>
and , by the way , we &apos;re capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the living self over time . </s>
if you ask for the happiness of the self , it &apos;s a very different thing . </s>
this is not about how happy a person lives . </s>
it &apos;s about how happy or deli@@ gh@@ ted that person is when that person thinks about their lives . </s>
very different term . </s>
anyone who &apos;s not different is going to mas@@ k the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m listening to a lot of researchers about well-being that mess@@ ed up the happiness of the happiness for a long time in this sort of way . </s>
the distin@@ ction between the happiness of the living self and the happiness of the memory itself has been realized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separ@@ ations . </s>
the gall@@ up organization has a worldwide survey , where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction . </s>
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve been starting to learn about the happiness of the two types of self . </s>
and the main lesson we have , i think , is that they &apos;re really different . </s>
you can know how happy somebody is with your life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy he lives with his life and vice ver@@ sa . </s>
just to give you an idea of the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 . </s>
what that means is , if you were going to meet somebody , and you &apos;d say , oh , his father is a two-@@ foot man , how much would you know about his size ? </s>
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certainty . </s>
they &apos;re so much un@@ certainty . </s>
when i tell you that somebody has ar@@ ran@@ ged their lives as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of un@@ certainty about how happy he is with his living self . </s>
so the cor@@ relation is low . </s>
we know something about what the happiness of happiness itself is . </s>
we know that money is very important , goals are very important . </s>
we know that happiness is mainly to be satis@@ fied with people we like to spend time with people we like . </s>
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant . </s>
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the happiness of the two types of self , you will do very different things at the end . </s>
and the impli@@ cation of what i &apos;ve said here is that we shouldn &apos;t really imagine happiness as a sub@@ stit@@ ute for well-being . </s>
it &apos;s a completely different term . </s>
well , very briefly , another reason we can &apos;t really think about happiness is that we don &apos;t care about the same things when we think about life , and when we actually live . </s>
so if you ask the simple question , how happy the people in california are not going to get the correct answer . </s>
if you ask this question , you think the people in california have to be happier than they say , let &apos;s say , in o@@ hi@@ o . </s>
and what happens is , when you think about life in california , you think of the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , you know , in the climate . </s>
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the memor@@ able self that deci@@ des how happy people are . </s>
well , because the memor@@ able self is responsible , you can end up at the end -- some people could go to california at the end . </s>
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pur@@ sue what happens to people moving to california in the hope of becoming happier . </s>
well , your life self is not going to be happier . </s>
we know this . </s>
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think you &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;ll be reminded of how terrible the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o , and you &apos;ll feel that you &apos;ve made the right decision . </s>
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how hard it is . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you . </s>
thank you . </s>
now , when we talked about a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a very interesting outcome that came out of this gall@@ on po@@ ll . </s>
is that something that you can share with us , because you &apos;ve got a few minutes left now ? </s>
daniel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure . </s>
i think the most interesting outcome we found at the gall@@ up gall@@ up is a number that we absolutely didn &apos;t expect to find . </s>
we found this in terms of the happiness of the living self . </s>
if we looked at how feelings v@@ ary with income . </s>
and it turns out that under an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for americans , that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , but it &apos;s a great represent@@ ative sample , under an income of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year . </s>
6@@ 0,000 . </s>
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 . </s>
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year is the people un@@ happy , and they become less un@@ happy , the poor@@ er the poor@@ er . </s>
and we get a absolutely flat line of this . </s>
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen such flat lines . </s>
what happens is , obviously , money doesn &apos;t make you any experience happiness , but that lack of money certainly makes you miser@@ able , and we can measure this miser@@ ably , very , very clear . </s>
in the spirit of the other self , the memory self , get a different story . </s>
the more money you make is the happier you are . </s>
it &apos;s not true of emotions . </s>
but dan@@ ny , in all of american en@@ dea@@ vor@@ s , is about life , freedom , the pur@@ suit of happiness . </s>
if people would take that fun@@ ds seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on the head , everything that we believe , for example , in terms of tax policy and so on . </s>
is there a chance that politicians , generally , would take a fund like this and would make it seriously policy ? </s>
d@@ k : you know , i believe that there is recognition for the role of happiness in politics . </s>
the recognition is going to be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s happening right now and in other countries in other countries . </s>
people are reali@@ zing that they should be thinking about happiness when they think about politics . </s>
it will take a while , and people will discuss if they want to explore experi@@ ential happiness , or whether they want to explore life ass@@ ess@@ ment , so we have to have this discussion pretty soon . </s>
how to increase happiness is very different from how you think and whether you think about the memory of yourself , or whether you &apos;re thinking about the survi@@ vor@@ s of yourself . </s>
that will affect politics , i think , in the next years . </s>
in the united states , you start measuring the experience of the population of the population . </s>
this will be , i think , in the next one or two decades of part of the national statistics . </s>
well , it seems to me that this is going to be the subject , or should at least be the most interesting political debate over the next few years . </s>
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics . </s>
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man . </s>
i &apos;m jane mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i design video games . </s>
i developed online games for 10 years . and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality , as it is in online games . </s>
i have a plan for it . i want to convince more people , including all of them , to spend more time playing bigger and great games and great games . </s>
currently we spend three billion hours a week playing online play . </s>
some of you might be thinking , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot; </s>
maybe something too much time , when you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world . </s>
in fact , i research on the institute for the future , which is exactly the opposite . </s>
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the most pres@@ sing problems of the world . </s>
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase this time . </s>
i calcul@@ ated that it took time for 21 billion hours a week at play every week . </s>
it may seem a little counter@@ intuitive , so i repe@@ at it : when we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade . </s>
no , i mean it really seriously . </s>
why ? this image describes pretty much why i believe that games are so essential to the survival of the human species in the future . seriously . </s>
this is a photographer by photographer phi@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o . </s>
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he built a camera in front of the players . </s>
this is one of the classic expres@@ sions of play . </s>
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you might have some of the nu@@ ances in this picture . </s>
you probably see this sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , something fear , but also concent@@ ration concent@@ ration , really dee@@ pen@@ ing into the solving of a really difficult problem . </s>
if you also play , you can see some nu@@ ances here , the eyes above the top , and the mouth is a sign of optimis@@ m . the eye@@ bro@@ ws show surprise . </s>
this is a player that stands on the edge of an epi@@ c vic@@ tory . </s>
oh , you know that . ok . great . so we &apos;ve got some players here . </s>
an epi@@ c vic@@ tory is a result which is so positive , that they didn &apos;t know it was possible at all . </s>
it was leg beyond the imagination . </s>
and when they can do it , they &apos;re sho@@ cked to actually be able to actually do that . this is an epi@@ c vic@@ tory . </s>
this player is just in front of an epi@@ c vic@@ tory . </s>
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of proble@@ m-@@ solving around the world when we take the shor@@ test of the next century , the face of the people who are standing on the edge of a epi@@ c vic@@ tory on the edge of an epi@@ c vic@@ tory . </s>
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re seeing this face in real life when we face difficult problems . </s>
i re@@ fer to it as the &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , do you see ? yes ? ok . </s>
that &apos;s me , like i am in life , making bad face in life . </s>
this is a gra@@ ff@@ iti in my former home at berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.@@ d. why we are better in play than we are in real life . </s>
that &apos;s a problem that many players have . </s>
we think that in reality we &apos;re not as good as we are in reality . </s>
and i don &apos;t just mean less success@@ fully , even though that &apos;s heard about it . </s>
we &apos;re doing more on play worlds , and i &apos;m very good at doing motivation with motivation to do something meaningful , inspired by collaboration . </s>
when we &apos;re in a play@@ ground , i believe that many of us turn into our best version , any@@ time and inst@@ ant , trying to solve the problem , trying to solve the problem as long as necessary , trying to test it again after the failure . </s>
and in reality , if we fail , when we hit obstac@@ les , we often feel different . </s>
we feel overwhel@@ med . we feel defe@@ ated , we feel threat@@ ened , perhaps depressed , fru@@ strated or cy@@ ni@@ cal . </s>
these feelings have never been when we play games , they just don &apos;t exist . </s>
and this is what i wanted to investi@@ gate as a graduate student . </s>
why is it impossible to think in games you could not just achieve anything ? </s>
how can we trans@@ mit these feelings from play into reality ? </s>
so i looked at games like world of war@@ craft , which offers the ideal environment for collaborative proble@@ m-@@ solving . </s>
and i &apos;ve found some things that can make epi@@ c sett@@ ings in online worlds like this . </s>
so , first of all , if you go to one of these online games , especially at world of war@@ craft , there are a lot of different characters willing to trust you to trust a global mission mission , inst@@ antly . </s>
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly at its current level in the game , right ? </s>
so they can do that . </s>
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve . </s>
but always at the edge of their cap@@ abilities , so they have to hard themselves , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ yment in the world of war@@ craft . </s>
you &apos;re not sitting around , and you &apos;re twi@@ sting , and there &apos;s always something important to do . </s>
and there &apos;s lots of collabor@@ ators . </s>
wherever you go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to close their epi@@ c mission . </s>
we don &apos;t have that in real life so easy , this sense that in a finger@@ ti@@ ps , we &apos;re ready to stand ready for a finger . </s>
also , there &apos;s this epi@@ c story , this inspiring story , why we &apos;re there and what we have to do . </s>
and then we get this whole positive feedback . </s>
you &apos;ve probably heard about &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot; </s>
this constant feedback is not in the real life . </s>
when i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have + + 1 and + 1 crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea . </s>
i don &apos;t get this feedback in the real life of that feedback . </s>
so , the problem of co@@ oper@@ ative online worlds like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to be on the edge of an epi@@ c vic@@ tory that we rather better spend our whole time in these game worlds . </s>
they &apos;re just better than the reality . </s>
until today , all of the world of war@@ cra@@ age players have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years of solving the virtual problems of a@@ cer@@ tic . </s>
this is not necessarily a bad thing . </s>
it might sound bad . </s>
but to see it in the context , 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago , our first pri@@ mate ancestors began to come up@@ right . </s>
so the first exciting pri@@ mate . </s>
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend on play at the moment , it makes sense when you keep the time in terms of the mag@@ ni@@ tude of human development , which is extraordinary . </s>
but also , it turns out that by using all this time we &apos;re using this all time , we actually change what we &apos;re able to do as human beings . </s>
we develop towards community thinking , heart creatures . </s>
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that . </s>
consider this interesting stati@@ stic that was published recently by a researcher of car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university : the average young person today in a country with strong play culture sp@@ ends 10,000 hours with online play online to 21 years of life . </s>
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number , for two reasons . </s>
first of all , for children in the united states , 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours are the accu@@ racy they spend in the school that they spend in school , from the fifth grade to the high school -- if you never have . </s>
so we have a complete parallel education path where young people learn exactly what it means to be a good player , like anything else they learn in school . </s>
and maybe some of you have read the new book by mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well , &quot; ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation . &quot; </s>
so you know the theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours . </s>
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that , if we spend 10,000 hours with the au@@ d@@ aci@@ ous theme of any subject to the 21st year , we &apos;re going to become a master of them . </s>
we &apos;re going to be as good at doing whatever the most significant people in the world do . </s>
so , what we have here is a full generation of young people who are master@@ -@@ players . </s>
so the big question is , &quot; what are the players master@@ y good ? &quot; </s>
because if we could find that , we would never have been there before before , there would be human potential . </s>
so many people now , we have in the world who spend at least one hour a day on online play . </s>
these are our master@@ -@@ player ; 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at &quot; something . &quot; </s>
and in the next decade we have another billion players who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily well in whatever . </s>
if you haven &apos;t heard it . </s>
the game industry designed con@@ sol@@ es that save energy and work on mobile phones , instead of the broad@@ band internet players , players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , brazil , brazil . </s>
you expect an extra billion player in the next decade . </s>
with that , we have 1.@@ 5 billion players . </s>
so i started thinking about what it is to master these games in our games . </s>
here are the four things i found . first of all , ur@@ gen@@ -@@ optimis@@ m . </s>
ok , think about the extreme self-@@ motiv@@ ator . </s>
ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m is the desire to do something right now , to master a bar@@ rier , along with the belief that we have a tremendous hope of success . </s>
players always believe that an epi@@ c vic@@ tory is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying to do it , and the same . </s>
players don &apos;t sit around . </s>
players are ma@@ sters in the spi@@ ders of social nets . </s>
there are a lot of interesting studies that show that we like people more after we played with them , even when they defe@@ ated us wrong . </s>
the reason for this is that there &apos;s a lot of trust to play with someone . </s>
we trust that somebody will spend time with us , that the rules are that we have the same goal and we remain the same as the game . </s>
so it en@@ ables that to grow bin@@ ary , trust and with each other . </s>
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships . </s>
happy productivity . fantastic ! </s>
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of war@@ cra@@ ck player is playing 22 hours a week as a particle job . </s>
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we rela@@ x or do nothing . </s>
we know that we work as a human being opti@@ mal , if we do hard , meaningful work . </s>
and players are always willing to work hard if they get the right job . </s>
and finally , epi@@ c meaning . </s>
players love to become part of the a@@ we of the mis@@ sions of planet@@ ary planet@@ ary . </s>
here &apos;s a back@@ -@@ of-@@ view formation to the right light . you know , you all know wikipedia , the greatest wi@@ ki of the world . </s>
the second largest wi@@ ki of the world , with nearly 8@@ 0,000 commit@@ te@@ es , is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki . </s>
five million people use it every month . </s>
they &apos;ve assem@@ bled more information about world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other topic in any other wi@@ ki of the world . </s>
they create an epi@@ c story . </s>
they create an epi@@ c source of knowledge about the world of war@@ craft . </s>
ok , so these are four super@@ powers that lead to a single outcome . players are super-@@ powerful , hop@@ eful individuals . </s>
it &apos;s people who believe that as individuals , they can change the world . </s>
and the only problem is that you believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real real . </s>
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve . </s>
ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va is a science scientist . </s>
his work is brilliant . he &apos;s looking at why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds . </s>
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to see less than a mass im@@ migr@@ ant in virtual worlds in virtual worlds environments . &quot; </s>
and this is an economist . so he &apos;s logical . </s>
and he says ... </s>
not like me -- i develop games ; i &apos;m kind of a mess . </s>
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more in online worlds than in real life . </s>
they can stick stronger social bon@@ ds in games than in real life , and they get more feedback and re@@ wards in play than in real life . </s>
so , he says it &apos;s totally logical that players are spending more time in the virtual world than in real life . </s>
i just agree , that &apos;s logical . </s>
but it &apos;s definitely not an opti@@ mal situation . </s>
we need to start turning the real world into a game . </s>
my inspiration comes from an event that is 2,@@ 500 years ago . </s>
you have these ancient cu@@ be cu@@ ts of sheep . you know ? </s>
in front of these fantastic game controll@@ ers , sheep had sheep . </s>
and these were the first of human beings to develop game tools . </s>
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ ian her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you might know this story , the story of how and why games were invented . </s>
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , games become more closely invented in the kingdom of ly@@ ri@@ cs during a fam@@ ine . </s>
sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly , there was such a great fam@@ ine that the king king of ly@@ ri@@ ans decided to be a crazy idea . </s>
people were suffering . people were fighting . </s>
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution . </s>
so they invented , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , the mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise and a national strategy , and one day you would eat , and the next day you would play the next day . </s>
and they would be so immer@@ sed in the cu@@ be because games are so fascinating and satis@@ fying us with gra@@ ti@@ fying , happy productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat . </s>
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat . </s>
and according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they survi@@ ved for so 18 years for this fam@@ ine by eating on one day and playing the next day . </s>
in the same way , i think we &apos;re going to play games today . </s>
we sit down games to escape the suffering of the physical world . </s>
we sit down games to make everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that is not satis@@ fying in real life , and we get what we need out of play . </s>
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end . </s>
that &apos;s the exciting thing . </s>
after 18 years of her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , fam@@ ine was not better better , so the king decided to put a final game on it . </s>
they divided the kingdom into two cam@@ ps . </s>
they were playing a cu@@ b@@ ble , and the vic@@ tories were allowed to break into an epi@@ c ad@@ venture . </s>
they left ly@@ ri@@ ans , and they went to search for a new home , and they had so many people returned to how food was survi@@ ving and looking for the rest of an area where they could thri@@ ve . </s>
this sounds crazy , right ? </s>
but latest dna evidence shows that the e@@ tr@@ us@@ ers who later formed the roman empire , they found the same dna as the old ly@@ ri@@ cs . </s>
and so scientists recently came to know that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos;s crazy story was actually true . </s>
and ge@@ ologists found evidence of a global cool@@ ing , which took almost 20 years , which could explain fam@@ ine . </s>
so this crazy story could be true . </s>
maybe they &apos;ve actually saved their people through play through games for 18 years , and then having this in@@ genu@@ ity and so much to play with each other , that they &apos;ve saved all the civilization . </s>
so we can also do that . </s>
we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft since 1994 . </s>
this was the first strategy in real time in the world of war@@ cra@@ tic series . this was 16 years ago . </s>
they played video games for 18 years , and we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years . </s>
i argue we &apos;re ready for our own epi@@ c game . </s>
so , they sent half their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;ll take my 21 billion game hours a week . </s>
we should sub@@ mit that half of us spend an hour a day playing with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the physical world . </s>
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in games ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve been doing over the last year at the institute of work at the institute of the future . </s>
we have this ban@@ ner in our office in pal@@ o al@@ to , expres@@ sing how we should understand the future . </s>
we don &apos;t want to try and tell the future before . </s>
what we want is to create the future . </s>
we want to introduce the best possible outcome , and then we want to em@@ power people into reality . </s>
we make epi@@ c sett@@ ings , and we give people the opportunity to achieve it . </s>
and i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and make people epi@@ c in their own future . </s>
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot; </s>
the game is in 2007 . </s>
it &apos;s an online game where you have to overcome the oil scar@@ city . </s>
the oil scar@@ ce is invented , but we have enough online content , so it &apos;s reali@@ stic to be reali@@ stic , and they actually live their real lives without oil . so , when they arri@@ ve at the game , they tell us where they live . and then they get news movies in real time that show you how much oil there is , how much oil is com@@ promis@@ ed , whether there are schools . and you have to figure out how to make your real life if it &apos;s true . and we ask you to blog@@ ging about blog@@ ging videos or photos . </s>
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been ac@@ compan@@ ied over the last three years since the last three years . </s>
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience . </s>
no one wants to change your life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should . </s>
but if you are in an epi@@ c ad@@ venture , and you said , &quot; we &apos;re going out of oil . &quot; </s>
this is an amazing ad@@ venture that you &apos;re going to be able to do . </s>
find out how they would survive . most of our players have main@@ ta@@ ined hab@@ its in the game . </s>
so , for the next world , we have a larger game for the next world , higher target than oil scar@@ city . </s>
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct &quot; at the institute for the future . </s>
starting the point is the calcu@@ lation of a super@@ computer , that people only have 23 years on the planet for 23 years . </s>
this super@@ computer is called the global mortality sensi@@ tivity system , of course , of course . </s>
the call to players , mel@@ ting , we almost designed a &quot; jer@@ r@@ y-@@ bru@@ ck@@ heal@@ er &quot; film . </s>
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movies , where there are the &quot; dre@@ am@@ y team , &quot; they have the astron@@ au@@ ts , the scientists , the ex@@ -@@ ed@@ ings , and only together they can save the world . </s>
but in our game , instead of just five people , let &apos;s say everyone is in the traffic team , and it &apos;s our job to create the future of energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice . </s>
8@@ ,000 players play the game for eight weeks . </s>
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they google &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct . &quot; </s>
and the last game is going to take us on march 3 , and this is a game in collaboration with the world bank . </s>
when you close the game , you get from the world bank of social change , gradu@@ ally , 2010 . </s>
we work with universi@@ ties in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , and we invite them to learn social re@@ design . </s>
we have a com@@ ic book . we have &quot; level high &quot; for local understanding , knowledge , knowledge connection , sustainability , vision and in@@ genu@@ ity . </s>
i want to invite all of you to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in developing areas that benefit from their own social enter@@ pris@@ es to save the world . </s>
i &apos;ll move to the end . </s>
i want to ask you something . </s>
what do you think happens next ? </s>
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we don &apos;t save the real world yet . </s>
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change . </s>
we have these whole super@@ powers , happy productivity , the ability to get close social nets , ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m and desire for epi@@ c meaning . </s>
i really hope that we play significant games to survive on this planet another century . </s>
and i hope you &apos;ll design and play with me those games . </s>
if i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can create any imagin@@ able future , and we can play all sorts of games . </s>
so i say , let &apos;s start the worl@@ d-@@ changing games . </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;d like to tell you something , which is a few months ago in the writing of a article for itali@@ an wired . </s>

of course , this was an excellent , old syn@@ ony@@ mous dictionary , and i just thought that the copy must be pretty old . </s>
but in fact , it was an issue in the early &apos; 80s , when i started element@@ ary school , and i started building my self-@@ image outside of my family environment , even in terms of other children and the rest of me around me . </s>
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use syn@@ ony@@ mous dictionary at that time . </s>
if i take this ent@@ ry seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose life cannot be posi@@ tively bi@@ ased , but today i &apos;m going to celebr@@ ate the opportunity and ad@@ venture that i &apos;ve been celebr@@ ating . </s>
so i immediately came up with the online copy of 2009 , and i expected me to find a sugge@@ stion here . </s>
here &apos;s the latest version of this ent@@ ry . </s>
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better . </s>
and in particular , the last two words under the last two words under &quot; neighbor ant@@ ony@@ ms &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot; </s>
but it &apos;s not just about the words . </s>
it &apos;s what we think about the people that we describe to these words . </s>
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values . </s>
our language impac@@ ts our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us . </s>
many ancient societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the roman@@ ce , have really believed that the language of a flight has a huge force , because what you can talk about loud is also mani@@ fest itself . </s>
so , what do we actually want to mani@@ fest -- a dis@@ abled man or a powerful person ? </s>
speaking one person alone , as a child , could enable them to bi@@ te them and re@@ cover them and re@@ cover them . </s> &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open them doors ? </s>
a man who opened doors for me was my pe@@ di@@ atri@@ cian at a.@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in wil@@ m@@ ington in del@@ ay . </s>
it &apos;s called dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ ti@@ llo , a it@@ al@@ o american , whose name , as you can imagine , most americans couldn &apos;t speak correc@@ tly , so he was always called dr. p@@ . </s>
and dr. p@@ . was always wearing very color@@ ed flight , and was just created for children with kids . </s>
i found the time that i &apos;ve spent in this hospital just great -- except for my physi@@ o@@ therapy . </s>
i had to repe@@ at individual practice frequ@@ ently with these thick , el@@ a@@ stic b@@ ands -- in different colors -- you know , you know , to build my leg muscles , and i &apos;ve hat@@ ed more than anything else than anything else . i hat@@ ed it . i &apos;ve hat@@ ed it . i hat@@ ed it . </s>
and imagine , even when i was a five-@@ year-old kid with dr. p@@ . negoti@@ ating dr. p@@ . and trying to stop these practices , naturally without success . </s>
and one day he looked at me in one of my practice -- these practices were just ti@@ ghtly ti@@ ring and g@@ ently -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll sh@@ ine one of those b@@ ands one day . </s>
and if you can do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot; </s>
this was just a simple trick by dr. p@@ . so i &apos;m doing the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the point of view that i wanted to be the rich@@ est five-@@ year-old girl in the second floor , but he actually brought me to see my daily practice hor@@ ror with new eyes , so it became a new and promis@@ ing experience . </s>
and i wonder today how very much his vision of me as a powerful and powerful girl has shaped my own picture , and i could imagine seeing myself as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful , at@@ titude and at@@ titude . </s>
this is just one example of many , as adults can relate to the power of a child . </s>
but like these already quot@@ ed examples of syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ aries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine what we would all want : it would enable us to allow anyone to see themselves as powerful people . </s>
our language indi@@ c@@ ates the social changes that have been trig@@ ger@@ ed in many cases through a technological change . </s>
from the medical point of view , of course , you can tell that my legs , the laser surgery for visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red , cu@@ sto@@ m of titan and artificial hi@@ stories for aging bodies , allowing people to really use all of their possibilities and to develop the limits that their natural fa@@ te has set out to develop , not to speak of social net@@ working plat@@ forms , people can give a personal identity in their own way , in their own way , and to ori@@ ent themselves to groups around the world that they choose to look at themselves . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s> &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s> &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
so perhaps this technological change illu@@ str@@ ates that there is always a different truth , which is that every person in society can give something special and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt is our biggest plus . </s>
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me how to deal with wi@@ dri@@ tions , and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this sentence has never adap@@ ted to me , and i &apos;ve always been very un@@ comfortable to answer the questions of people , and i think gradu@@ ally i understand why . </s>
this sentence of dealing with wi@@ ves lives by the idea that success or happiness depends on taking a challenge without being shaped by the experience of being connected , as if my life was so successful , because i could avoid the potential of a life of life with a pros@@ thetic , or whatever people perceive me with my dis@@ ability . </s>
but the truth is that we change . of course , we &apos;re shaped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotional or even both of them . </s>
and i &apos;m suggest@@ ing that this is good . </s>
pen@@ dri@@ ties are not a obstac@@ le that we need to en@@ h@@ ance to be better with our lives . </s>
wi@@ dri@@ ves are simply simply in our lives . </s>
and i tend to see ur@@ gen@@ cy as my shadow . </s>
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he can &apos;t see it , but he &apos;s constantly with me . </s>
and i don &apos;t want to put the impact on the impact of a human bat@@ ch of a human . </s>
there are life in life and challenges , and they &apos;re just real real and every person is going to be different , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not we &apos;re going to be clear or not , but how we &apos;re going to be able to do that . </s>
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to keep in front of f@@ loo@@ ds , but also prepar@@ ing them to get good at it . </s>
and we don &apos;t like our kids if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt . </s>
you &apos;ve got to separate two things : to be ampu@@ t@@ ated , to be ampu@@ t@@ ated , and to the other social opinion , whether i &apos;m dis@@ abled or not . </s>
and to be honest , the only real and permanent dis@@ ability that i have had to deal with , is that the world always means that the world is constantly able to describe me with these defini@@ tions . </s>
in our desire to protect people who care about us and they care about the cold , hard truth about their health proce@@ dur@@ es , or even even a predi@@ ction of the quality of life that they &apos;re expe@@ cting , we have to watch that we don &apos;t actually make the bas@@ eline that somebody is actually dis@@ abled . </s>
perhaps the current concept , which is just about what &apos;s broken , and how we fix it , and how we repair it for each individual a larger dis@@ ability than the path@@ ology is . </s>
if we don &apos;t treat a human being holi@@ stic , and not see all the forces and its opportunities and ac@@ knowledge , in addition to the natural world , we may need to lead one another disease . </s>
we &apos;re degra@@ ding a human society that has value a value for our society . </s>
so we have to look beyond the pat@@ ology and focus on all the human possibilities . </s>
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the sense of our in@@ genu@@ ity and our great inven@@ tions , a connection . </s>
we shouldn &apos;t de@@ fy or den@@ y these challenging times , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , nor do we turn them under the ru@@ g , but it &apos;s about recogni@@ zing od@@ ds . </s>
it &apos;s probably more about making me realize that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get through jo@@ ints , but we &apos;re open to put them open , put them on the tail , to use a com@@ pound expression , and maybe even dance with it . </s>
and perhaps we can manage to see wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad as something natural , co@@ her@@ ent and useful , and feel like we don &apos;t feel like that through their presence . </s>
this year we celebrate the 200@@ th birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , pointed out to something very true in the human character . </s>
i would kill it like this : not the most powerful of its kind , and not the most intelligent of its kind , but the changes that can best adapt to the best . </s>
from conflict to conflict . </s>
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of human beings to survive and fl@@ our@@ ish , by the struggle of the human spirit , is determined by conflict . </s>
so , again , change and adap@@ tation are the greatest skills of the human . </s>
and maybe we just know what wood we &apos;re car@@ ing about if we really tested it . </s>
perhaps that is the sense of persi@@ st@@ ence , a sense of icon@@ s , a sense of our own power . </s>
we can give ourselves something like this . </s>
we can give a new meaning to a new meaning that goes beyond severe times . </s>
maybe we can see ur@@ gen@@ cies as change . </s>
ad@@ ver@@ sity are a change that we haven &apos;t ac@@ ted in yet . </s>
i believe that the biggest damage that we have is belie@@ ving in belie@@ ving that we should be normal . </s>
the truth is , who &apos;s normal ? </s>
there is no normal normal . </s>
there &apos;s a common thing . the typical thing , but not the normal one , and would you really want to learn the poor , gray person really , if you really would ? </s>
i don &apos;t think any more . </s>
it would be great if we would , if we could replace this paradigm of normal or strength , or strength , to actually make it a little bit more dangerous , exchange , and so we can release the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills into society . </s>
tw@@ ins have found that we &apos;ve always challen@@ ged people with the members of our society : to be useful and to make a contribu@@ tion to a contribu@@ tor to a contribu@@ tion . </s>
there are evidence that the neanderth@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical inju@@ ries have contribu@@ ted to them , and that might happen because the life experience in the survival of these people was valuable for society . </s>
they didn &apos;t look at these people as broken and us@@ eless ; they were treated as something special and valuable . </s>
a few years ago , i went to the city where i grew up , in a food market in this red zone , in the nor@@ the@@ astern of pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was in front of a head of toma@@ to toma@@ toes . </s>
it was summer , and i had shor@@ ts . </s>
and i hear a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot; </s>
and i turn around , and i see this older man . i have no idea who he is . </s>
and i was like , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot; </s>
and he said , &quot; well , you don &apos;t remember me very much . </s>
when i first saw her , i brought her out of the bel@@ ly of her mother . &quot; </s>
oh , so that . </s>
and of course , it did make it click . </s>
this was dr. ke@@ an , a man i knew only from my mother &apos;s story about this day , because i of course , of course , came to my birthday two weeks after my birthday . </s>
my mother &apos;s pr@@ ol@@ at@@ al diagno@@ sis of my mother &apos;s vac@@ ation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all . </s>
and because i was born without wa@@ king legs , and my feet had focused on them , and i just had a few toes on this foot and a few toes on the other foot , this strangers , that strangers had to bring out the bad news . </s>
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never would be as mobile as other kids , or that you could never have an independent life , and since then , you &apos;ve just pun@@ ished me . &quot; </s>
in fact , i found that he collected ti@@ ckets of my entire childhood , no matter whether i had won at a letter competition in the second grade , whether i was going to hal@@ f@@ way to hal@@ f@@ way to hal@@ f@@ way to hal@@ f@@ way , whether i had my schol@@ ar@@ ship or one of my spor@@ es to teach his students to teach his students to teach his students , medical students from the ha@@ h@@ ne@@ men medical school and her@@ s@@ hey medical school . </s>
and he called this part of his course the x factor , the potential of human will@@ ing@@ ness . </s>
you can &apos;t em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze enough how much critical this factor can be for the quality of a human being . </s>
and dr. ke@@ an said , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if they don &apos;t always say anything else , and even if they get a little bit of support , if you leave children to themselves , kids can achieve a lot . &quot; </s>
you see , dr. ke@@ an has changed his thinking . </s>
he had understood that the medical diagno@@ sis , and how someone could do it , are two different things . </s>
and i &apos;ve also changed my thinking over time if they &apos;d asked me at the age of 15 , whether i &apos;d have de@@ alt with my pros@@ thetic legs of meat and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have h@@ unt for a second . </s>
i really wanted to be normal at that time . </s>
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure . </s>
and this is what happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite that experience . </s>
and perhaps that change could also happen because i &apos;ve met so many people who have opened doors , rather than seeing people who restri@@ cted me , or i want to im@@ pose an idea . </s>
you see , it really takes one person to show you how they can mani@@ fest their forces , and they &apos;re through . </s>
if you allow someone to activ@@ ate their own , inner forces , the human mind , the human mind is so gr@@ atu@@ it@@ ous -- if you can do that , and for somebody in a key moment in a moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher for these people . </s>
they teach them to open their own doors . </s>
the actual meaning of the word &quot; relations &quot; in the word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot; </s>
it means making something that is in one to ti@@ ck@@ le the potential . </s>
again , what potential do we want to call out ? </s>
in the 196@@ 0s , a case study was done in the u.k. , and then gy@@ m@@ n@@ asi@@ ans were conver@@ ted in big schools . </s>
they call this &quot; stre@@ aming man in the u.s. &quot; in the united states we call it &quot; tracking . &quot; </s>
the students are divided into notes . </s>
and the a student is tested in co@@ in , getting the better teachers and so on and so forth . </s>
they then have given over a three-@@ month period of time with a &quot; suffi@@ cient &quot; the note &quot; the note &quot; very good , and they were told that they were very smart , and after those three months , they were really written . </s>
and of course , it dis@@ rup@@ ts the heart that in@@ ver@@ ted the one student has been told , they &apos;re just suffi@@ cient . </s>
and in the same way , it was after the three months . </s>
but only those who were still in school -- aside from the students who had s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed the school . </s>
and what was really important about this trial was that the teachers were not up@@ set . </s>
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed . </s>
and they were just told that the students were the students , and that are the students with the note , and the same thing is that they taught them something and they treat them . </s>
the only real dis@@ ability is a broken spirit that has been broken , has no hope anymore . he finds no more beauty . he doesn &apos;t have our natural , chil@@ dish curious , and our in@@ genu@@ ity of imagination . </s>
but if we can manage to support the human spirit , continue to hope , to hope , to find yourself and other people around the world , to be curious , curious and fan@@ t@@ asy to be our forces really positive . </s>
if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new space . </s>
i want to end with a poem that was taken by a persi@@ an poet called ha@@ fi@@ z in the 14@@ th century , and my friend jac@@ ques dem@@ o told me . and the poem is called &quot; the god who knows only four words . &quot; &quot; every child knows god , god knows god , not the god &apos;s god , but the god who knows only four words and repe@@ at them repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly , he always says , come on , dance with me . &quot; </s>
come with me . thank you very much . </s>
how would you want to be better than you were right now ? </s>
suppose i said that through a few changes of their genes , a better memory could be -- more precise , more and faster . </s>
or do you want to be more fit@@ ter , more stronger , more force . </s>
do you want to become more attra@@ ctive and more confi@@ dent ? </s>
what would it be like to live longer with good health ? </s>
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who has always known for more creativity . </s>
what would you like the most ? </s>
which one would you like to have if you could have one of them ? </s>
creativity . </s>
how many people would choose creativity ? </s>
raise your hands . let me see . </s>
a couple , probably about as many of you as creative people have here . </s>
that &apos;s very good . </s>
how many would choose to make a good memory ? </s>
just a few more . </s>
how about fit@@ ness ? </s>
a few less . </s>
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ? </s>
ah , the majority . this is what i like to call a doctor . </s>
if you could just have one of them , it would be a totally different world . </s>
is all this just one-@@ on-@@ one ? </s>
or is it possibly possible ? </s>
evolution has been a continu@@ ous issue on the ted conference , but today i want to give you a view of a doctor &apos;s view of the doctor . </s>
the great gene@@ tic@@ ist in the 20th century , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also a communic@@ ator in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , once wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense out of evolution . &quot; </s>
now , if you &apos;re one of those who doesn &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , that would be a very good time to switch out your hearing device , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you the per@@ mission -- and maybe you can take a look at ka@@ thr@@ yn school tz &apos; book , which is about wrong , because nothing in the other course of this speech will make any sense of you . </s>
but if you accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it also about the future ? </s>
is it for others , or is it also us ? </s>
this is another look at the tree of life . </s>
in this picture , i &apos;ve laid a bush as a center of bran@@ ches in all directions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , all the existing species at the top of these bran@@ ches have success in evolutionary terms , they survi@@ ved ; it survi@@ ved its environment fit@@ ness and strength . </s>
the human part of this book , far at the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in . </s>
we doubt from a common ance@@ stor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago . </s>
in this period of time , maybe there were 20 or 25 different species of hom@@ ini@@ ds . </s>
some have come and went . </s>
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years . </s>
it seems like we &apos;re fairly remote from the other parts of the building of life , but actually most of the time , the fundamental mechanis@@ ms of our cells are pretty much the same . </s>
do you realize that we can take advantage of it , and the mechanis@@ ms of a common bacteri@@ um to produce the protein of the human insulin protein , which is used to treat diab@@ e@@ tics ? </s>
this is not like human@@ insulin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemi@@ cally in@@ different from what &apos;s coming out of the pan@@ cre@@ as . </s>
and as we speak about bacteria , are you aware that each one of us in our gut runs more bacteria than it does in the rest of our bodies ? </s>
maybe 10 times . </s>
i mean , do you think when ant@@ oni@@ o dama@@ si@@ o asks for your self-@@ image , do you think about the bacteria ? </s>
our gut is a wonder@@ fully hospit@@ alized environment for these bacteria . </s>
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s fir@@ ing , it &apos;s very comfortable . </s>
and you &apos;re going to offer all of the nutri@@ ents that you could only wish to provide without effort . </s>
it &apos;s a really easy way for bacteria , with occasi@@ onally inter@@ rup@@ tions of the un@@ intended , je@@ wel@@ ry forced to ex@@ it . </s>
but else , they are a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they are important for their lives . </s>
they help with the di@@ ge@@ stion of food nutri@@ ents , and they protect them against certain diseases . </s>
but what will happen in the future ? </s>
are we in some kind of evolutionary balance in a shape of a species ? </s>
or are we going to become something different -- something that might be even better adap@@ ted to the environment ? </s>
let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first indi@@ cations of living beings , maybe three or four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-@@ cell@@ ular organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years -- and then the human species , which shape in the last 13@@ 0,000 years . </s>
in this vast un@@ finished symph@@ ony of the universe , life on earth is only briefly measuring ; the animal kingdom , like a single spot , and the human life , a small not@@ ation . </s>
that &apos;s what we were doing . </s>
and this is also the entertainment value of this talk , which is why i hope you enjo@@ yed it . </s>
now , when i was a ne@@ ct@@ ar in college , i had my first biology classes . </s>
i was fascinated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology . </s>
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i put something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in individual organisms divi@@ des every cell cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is led into both daughter cells . </s>
but at the time , when mul@@ tic@@ ell@@ ular organisms came along , things started to change . </s>
sexual bre@@ eding is coming into the picture . </s>
and importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of the sexual re@@ production that the genome continues , the rest of the body will dri@@ ft down . </s>
in fact , you could say that the inevi@@ t@@ ability of the death of our body goes into evolution at the same moment as the sexual re@@ production . </s>
now i have to say , when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed quite reas@@ onable at the time , but at every year , it &apos;s come to my bro@@ ad double . </s>
i came to understand the feelings of george bur@@ ns , who in las v@@ eg@@ as did his show in the &apos; 90s . </s>
and one night , there &apos;s a p@@ at on his hotel room . </s>
he opens the door . </s>
in front of him , he &apos;s a beautiful gar@@ den@@ ed sho@@ w@@ girl . </s>
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-@@ sex . &quot; </s>
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the sou@@ p . &quot; </s>
i came to the reali@@ zation as a doctor that i was doing a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily con@@ tradi@@ c@@ tory , only different . </s>
i was trying to maintain the body . </s>
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy . </s>
i wanted to re@@ build the health of the disease . </s>
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life . </s>
evolution is all about the exten@@ sion of the genome to the next generation , adap@@ tation and survival to generation . </s>
from an evolutionary point of view , they and i developed the bo@@ ar@@ ster rock@@ ets to send the genetic fra@@ mes into the next stage of the orbit , to then fall into the ocean . </s>
i think we would all understand the mo@@ od that woo@@ dy did all of the time when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to reach im@@ mortality from my work . </s>
i want to do it by not dying . &quot; </s>
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to pre@@ tend the lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty of life . </s>
it &apos;s not inevi@@ table to the biggest , the most powerful or the fa@@ stest , and not even the bri@@ gh@@ test . </s>
evolution privi@@ le@@ ged the creatures that adapt most to their environment . </s>
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success . </s>
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are bacteria that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ l , and therefore the hot ste@@ am survival , if if fish were there , there would be vac@@ uum fish for the result , yet they managed to make it an habit@@ able environment for themselves . </s>
so , what does that mean when we look at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space in evolution , and particularly as we &apos;re predi@@ cting the next phase , i think there would be a number of possibilities . </s>
the first is that we &apos;re not going to continue . </s>
we have achieved a form of equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um . </s>
and the reason for this is that , first of all , we &apos;ve managed to get a lot of genes to get a lot of genes that would have been chosen and would have been removed from the population . </s>
and secondly , as a species , we &apos;ve been con@@ fron@@ ting our environment so that we &apos;ve done it , that they adapt to us all the time , and we adapt to them . </s>
and by the way , we hi@@ ke and circu@@ late and bl@@ end ourselves so much that they can no longer say that isol@@ ation is necessary for evolution to pro@@ mote . </s>
a second possibility is that it will be an evolution of the traditional way , of course , by the forces of nature . </s>
and the argument here is that the whe@@ els of evolution are slowly ma@@ pping , but they &apos;re un@@ comfortable . </s>
and so far of isol@@ ation goes , when we coloni@@ ze distant planet as a species , it will give insu@@ lation and the changes in the environment that could produce evolution in a natural way . </s>
but there is a third option , a lo@@ ving , fascinating and scary possibility . </s>
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new development that is not just natural , but led and decided to make us as an individual , in the choices that we do . </s>
well , how could this happen ? </s>
how could it be that we could do this ? </s>
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making decisions about their off@@ spring . </s>
they are , in some cultures , the choices to have more men than women . </s>
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are deci@@ ding . </s>
so think , if it wasn &apos;t just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to adop@@ t genetic custom@@ i@@ zation to he@@ al disease and prevent disease . </s>
what if they could make the genetic changes for getting diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or elimin@@ ating cancer risk or elimin@@ ating stro@@ kes ? </s>
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ? </s>
if we look forward , these kinds of changes are going to be increasingly possible . </s>
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years . </s>
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars . </s>
the next year when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in dr@@ one and four months . </s>
today , you can complete a sequence of three billion base pa@@ irs of the human genome at a price of about $ 20,000 and in the space for about a week . </s>
it will not take long for the reality to be reality , that it will give the 1,000 dollars of human genome , and it will increasingly be available for everyone . </s>
so a week ago , the national academy of engineering for franc@@ is ar@@ n@@ old and wil@@ lem ste@@ mmer , two scientists who developed the natural process of encoura@@ ging evolution to work faster and to des@@ c@@ end proteins in a more efficient way -- which fran@@ ces ar@@ n@@ old calls direct evolution . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
a few years ago , the laser prize was awar@@ ded by the scientist sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took a adult house , a fi@@ bro@@ c@@ ist , and through the manipu@@ lation of only four genes , the cell indu@@ ced them back to a plu@@ ri@@ po@@ tent stem cell -- a cell potentially potentially is able to become any cell in your body . </s>
these changes are coming in . </s>
the same technology that produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that don &apos;t just protect themselves , but also to serve imm@@ unity to other viruses . </s>
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experiment@@ al study in the gang with influ@@ enz@@ a that has been built into the cells of a tab@@ o@@ o plant . </s>
can you imagine something good that comes from to@@ bac@@ co ? </s>
this is all reality today , and the future will be much more possible . </s>
now , imagine two other little changes in front of you . </s>
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your driving ? </s>
what if they could change the sper@@ m and the eggs or the fres@@ h@@ man egg , to give their kids a better chance for a heal@@ thi@@ er life -- elimin@@ ating diabetes , remove the risk of cancer , the risk of cancer , the risk of cancer ? </s>
who doesn &apos;t want a heal@@ thi@@ er child ? </s>
and then the analy@@ tical technology , the same engine of science that can enable the changes to prevent disease , could also allow us to adop@@ t super-@@ attribu@@ tes , hyper@@ -@@ capacity -- the better memory . </s>
why don &apos;t we have the power quality of a ken h@@ ence , especially if you can ex@@ tend it with the next generation of the wat@@ son machine ? </s>
why not have the fast muscle fi@@ bers that will enable you to run faster and longer ? </s>
why no longer live ? </s>
these are going to be resi@@ stant . </s>
and if we are in a position where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t the attribu@@ tes that we want , we will be transformed from al@@ t-@@ style evolution to ne@@ o-@@ evolution . </s>
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires probably 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it for a thousand years -- and maybe even over the next hundred years . </s>
these are decisions that need to deal with their grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , to be able to deal with . </s>
are we using these decisions to form a society that is better , the more successful , the more friendly ? </s>
or are we going to selec@@ tively choose different attribu@@ tes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ? </s>
will we form a society form more pro@@ li@@ fic and uni@@ form@@ er , or will we be robust and more robust and more ver@@ si@@ fied ? </s>
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be facing . </s>
and most of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom of the wisdom that we need in order to make these decisions ? </s>
for good or evil , and so@@ on@@ er than you think , these decisions are going to be on us . </s>
thank you . </s>
i want you to imagine that now , a port@@ able robot that gives you human skills , or another , the wheelchair helps to stand up and go back and forth . </s>
we at berkeley bi@@ onics call these robots ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ons . </s>
they &apos;re nothing different than something that they &apos;re putting in the morning and putting them extra strength , and that &apos;s going to increase their vel@@ o@@ city , and that &apos;s going to help them keep their balance . </s>
that is indeed the real mel@@ ting of man and machine . </s>
but not just that -- bl@@ aming and connect with the universe and other devices out there . </s>
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea . </s>
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers who carry about 100 pounds on their backs , and it &apos;s the question that they should carry more equipment . </s>
of course , this leads to some major compli@@ cations -- back inju@@ ries , 30 percent of them -- chr@@ onic decre@@ ases . </s>
so we thought we would take this challenge and create an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that would help deal with this problem . </s>
so let me introduce you to h@@ ul@@ c -- or the human universal source car@@ car@@ rier . </s>
soldi@@ er : with the h@@ ul@@ c ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , i can carry 200 pounds across different terrain , for many hours . </s>
its flexible design en@@ ables you to ho@@ p deep , cra@@ w@@ l and highly e@@ ager movements . </s>
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then my strength increases my strength and last . </s>
we &apos;re at the same time with our industrial partners , this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on . </s>
so it &apos;s true . </s>
so let &apos;s take a look at the wheelchair driver , something that i &apos;m very passionate about . </s>
there are 6@@ 8 million people who are sitting in a wheelchair all over the world . </s>
that &apos;s about one percent of the total population . </s>
and that is indeed a conserva@@ tive estimate . </s>
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cor@@ d in@@ jury , which in the flo@@ od of their lives -- 20@@ s , 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s -- were hit by dest@@ iny , and the wheelchair is the only option . </s>
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , where they multi@@ p@@ ly , they multi@@ p@@ ly . </s>
and pretty much the only option -- when it comes to a brain attack , or other compli@@ cations -- is the wheelchair . </s>
and so by the way , it &apos;s been around for 500 years since this , as i &apos;ve got to say , very successful introdu@@ ction . </s>
so we thought we could start to write a whole new chapter in mo@@ bility of mo@@ bility . </s>
let me introduce you to ele@@ ct box@@ tel that &apos;s carried by am@@ anda box@@ tel , who suff@@ ered a spinal cor@@ d in@@ jury 19 years ago that she decided that she couldn &apos;t walk anymore for 19 years and now . </s>
thank you . </s>
as i said , am@@ anda is carrying our ele@@ es . </s>
it has sensors . </s>
his completely non-@@ invasi@@ ve sensors in the cru@@ t@@ ches , the signals send back on our on@@ bo@@ ar@@ d computer , which is attached to your back on your back . </s>
here are batter@@ ies of batter@@ ies , the motor drive is on their hi@@ ps , as well as their k@@ ne@@ es , which they move forward in this pretty smo@@ oth and very natural way . </s>
i was 24 years old , and in best form , when a mon@@ soon pure pure tree tree was paraly@@ zed during a ski ride . </s>
in the fra@@ ction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my be@@ ard . </s>
not long after that , a doctor went into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you can never walk again . &quot; </s>
and this was 19 years ago . </s>
he steel every five hope of my consciousness . </s>
adap@@ tive technologies have been able to learn to drive again , to climb , to climb and even drive the hands of the hands . </s>
but nothing had been invented that would leave me again , until now . </s>
thank you . </s>
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to meet and discuss with them . </s>
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here for changing life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for am@@ anda here and all the wheelchair dri@@ vers , but for everyone . </s>
thank you . </s>
at home in new york , i &apos;m the director of the development department of a non@@ profit organization called ro@@ bin hood . </s>
if i don &apos;t fight the poverty , i f@@ ought for a fire@@ man of a fire@@ man on a volunte@@ er trig@@ ger to trig@@ ger the fire . </s>
well , in our city , in the volunte@@ er , a highly quali@@ fied professional fire , they have to be pretty early on the br@@ ink to be able to participate . </s>
i remember my first fire . </s>
i was the second volunte@@ er at the br@@ ink , so i had quite good opportunities for being able to do that . </s>
but there was still a way to get to the other volunteers to get to the responsible man and find out what our jobs would be . </s>
when i found the main man , he had just been in a very serious conversation with the home ow@@ ner who had certainly had one of the worst days of their lives . </s>
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood on the s@@ hal@@ low and bar@@ e@@ foot under a screen outside of the rain while her house was standing in fl@@ ames . </s>
the other volunte@@ er who was close to me -- let &apos;s call him le@@ x lu@@ ther -- got the main man first , and was asked to go to the house and save the dog &apos;s dog . </s>
the dog ! i was an@@ xi@@ ous about en@@ vy . </s>
there was some lawyer or prof@@ its that could now tell people for the rest of his life that he could tell people that he was going into a burning house to save a living creature , just because he was five seconds faster than me . </s>
well , i was the next one . </s>
the main man ble@@ w me up . </s>
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , you &apos;ve got to go to the house . </s>
you &apos;ve got to go up there , on the fire of your fire , and this woman must get a pair of shoes . &quot; </s>
i swe@@ ar it . </s>
well , not exactly what i hop@@ ed for , but i went -- the sta@@ ir@@ case , the sta@@ ir@@ case , the flo@@ od , the real fire@@ men , who at this point were pretty much done at this point in time , into the bedro@@ om , into the bedro@@ om of the bedro@@ om . </s>
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero . </s>
i was wearing my pre@@ y back to where i met my ne@@ ck enemy and the belo@@ ved dog . </s>
we put our treas@@ ures out outside the house of the house , where , not surprisingly , he got a lot more attention than mine . </s>
a few weeks later , the fire@@ men received a letter to the house of the house , where she beg@@ ged for the bra@@ ve use of her house rescu@@ e . </s>
it was a kin@@ dly appreci@@ ated kin@@ dness : somebody even brought a pair of shoes . </s>
both in my prof@@ ession in ro@@ bin hood and in my side as a volunte@@ er fire@@ man , i &apos;m a witness of gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness in the lar@@ ge-@@ scale scale , but i see the next love love and mu@@ d of individuals . </s>
and do you know what i &apos;ve learned ? </s>
they &apos;re all important . </s>
so if i look in this room and i see people who have either achieved a reas@@ onable success or are on their way , i want to offer that memory : don &apos;t wait . </s>
don &apos;t wait for you to make a difference in another &apos;s life until you &apos;ve reached your first million . </s>
when you have something , you give it now . </s>
you put it in a sou@@ p kitchen , you place a park in the neighborhood . </s>
be a ment@@ or . </s>
not every day , we will give us an opportunity to save the life of a human , but every day we give us the opportunity to change one . </s>
so put rid of it ; save the shoes . </s>
thank you . </s>
brun@@ o gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , mark , come back . </s>

i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret to humanity &apos;s e@@ state . </s>
a place where women are leading the cep@@ tor with sex with sex &quot; hello &quot; and the game determin@@ es the day -- where fun is a serious business . </s>
and no , it &apos;s not about you or san francisco . </s>
ladies and gentlemen , their relationships . </s>
this is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the ur@@ ani@@ um of congo . </s>
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are together with chimpanzees with our clo@@ s@@ est living relative . </s>
that means we have a common ance@@ stor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago . </s>
now , chimpanzees are known for their aggressi@@ ve . </s>
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve co@@ ined this aspect of human evolution in the narrative of human evolution . </s>
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are showing us the other side of the me@@ dal . </s>
while chimpanzees are led to big , scary guys , the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are led to em@@ powered female fe@@ males . </s>
they &apos;ve really come up with something , because that leads to a pre@@ domin@@ antly toler@@ ant society where leth@@ al force force has not been seen . </s>
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are least known among the pri@@ mates . </s>
they live in the deep of the con@@ gol@@ ese ur@@ whale , and the observation is only accessible to the observation . </s>
the congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the fo@@ unding of a violent argument that has ra@@ ced for decades and leg ah as many lives as the first world war . </s>
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction also threat@@ ens the survival of the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s . </s>
meat trade and the decline in the tree is that you can &apos;t even fill a stadium with the rema@@ ining bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- and even that we &apos;re not sure to be honest . </s>
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden laugh that the trees are sh@@ ining . </s>
who are these related ? </s>
we know it as &quot; love instead of war &quot; monkeys , because they have more , bis@@ ex@@ ual sex , changing partners , and rules of conflict and social aff@@ air@@ s . </s>
i &apos;m not saying that would be the answer to all the human@@ itarian problems -- because the life of bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s is made up of more than cam@@ a su@@ tra . </s>
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- like people -- love to play their lives for a long time . </s>
play doesn &apos;t just mean child games . </s>
for us and for us , it &apos;s fundamental to the atta@@ ch@@ ment of relationships and the care of toler@@ ance . </s>
and we learn trust , and the rules of the game . </s>
play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections . </s>
and if you look at bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the game , you can see the evolutionary orig@@ ins of human la@@ p , dance and the ritu@@ als . </s>
play is the ti@@ ck@@ le that jo@@ ins us together . </s>
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wil@@ der@@ ness . </s>
first of all , a game of bon@@ o@@ bo@@ o type -- and i don &apos;t think of soc@@ cer ball . </s>
so here we see a young female and males in a tracking play game . </s>
look at what she does . </s>
this could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; she puts it in the eggs . &quot; </s>
just that i think they like it more likely , not true . </s>
yeah . </s>
so sex games are distributed , both with bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and people . </s>
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the idea of the idea of creating new elements with new elements -- like the ho@@ ws -- and also how the game challenges both trust and pro@@ mot@@ ing -- while it &apos;s tremendous fun at the same time . </s>
but the game is a form@@ er . </s>
play is a form@@ er , and it can take a lot of shapes , some of which are quiet , fan@@ ci@@ ful , curious -- maybe to discover the amazing again . </s>
and i want to show you , this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she &apos;s playing peac@@ efully with water . </s>
i think , just like they &apos;re playing , we &apos;re sometimes playing alone , and we &apos;re reading limits of our inner and ex@@ ternal worlds . </s>
and it &apos;s this play@@ ful curiosity that makes us look forward and interact , and the unexpected connection that we create is the real nutri@@ tional ground of creativity . </s>
this is just a little taste of the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s give us in our past and present present . </s>
but they also true a secret secret to our future , a future where we have to adapt to increasing challenges , through greater creativity , through larger cooperation . </s>
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is key . </s>
in other words , play is our adap@@ tive . </s>
to success@@ fully adapt to an un@@ fortunate world , we have to play . </s>
but are we going to make the best of our play drive ? </s>
play is not sil@@ ly . </s>
it &apos;s essential . </s>
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans , life is not made of teeth and cla@@ ws alone . </s>
just if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , maybe play is the most necessary . </s>
and therefore , my pri@@ mate cam@@ ps , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution and play together together as we re@@ discover the creativity of the cr@@ ani@@ tion and the wonder of wonder . </s>
thank you . </s>
i want you to imagine two pa@@ irs , mid-@@ 197@@ 9 , on exactly the same day , in the same moment , each one of your baby -- okay . </s>
so two pa@@ irs , each one is a baby . </s>
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imag@@ ining the stuff , because if you think of creation all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me . </s>
think of it for a moment . </s>
and in this scen@@ ario , you can imagine that , in a case , the sper@@ m is a y ch@@ om@@ o@@ so@@ m , which hits the x chromo@@ some of the egg . </s>
and in the other case , the sper@@ m is wearing a x chromo@@ some that hits the x chromo@@ some of the egg . </s>
both of them are survi@@ ving ; they &apos;re both light . </s>
we &apos;re still getting back to these people later . </s>
most of my activities , i &apos;ve had two hip co@@ vers . </s>
it &apos;s a hat i &apos;m involved in a hat of anatom@@ y with the story of anatom@@ y . </s>
i &apos;m a trained histor@@ ian , and in this case i study how people went to anatom@@ y with anatom@@ y -- that means human body , animal bodies -- how they moved around with body flu@@ ids , with body concepts , as they thought about body . </s>
the other hat i carried in work is the activ@@ ist of the activ@@ ist , as a patient lawyer -- or , as i sometimes say , as an im@@ patient lawyer -- of people who are doctors of doctors . </s>
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have bodies that have social nor@@ ms in question . </s>
so for example , i worked with people who are si@@ am@@ es@@ ic tw@@ ins , two people in a body . </s>
i &apos;ve been working with people with cu@@ bs -- so people who are smaller than usual . </s>
and very often , i &apos;ve worked with inter@@ sexual people whose gender are at@@ yp@@ ical -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or the female body types . </s>
and as a common term , we can use the word inter@@ sexu@@ ality . </s>
inter@@ sexu@@ ality comes from a lot of different shapes . </s>
i &apos;m just going to give you a couple of examples of the kinds of gender vari@@ ants that are not de@@ voted to the male or female standard . </s>
in one case , you might have someone with a x@@ y chromo@@ some , and the s@@ ry gene of y ch@@ om@@ o@@ som@@ s takes the proto@@ gon@@ ads that we all have fe@@ tal stadium to te@@ ar up . </s>
and that &apos;s why the ho@@ ds are giving off fe@@ tal stage te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one . </s>
but because this individual is missing the re@@ cep@@ tors to detect the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one . </s>
and that &apos;s called the and@@ ro@@ gen@@ re@@ cep@@ tor defe@@ ct . </s>
so a lot of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to that . </s>
as a result , the body develop@@ s more of the typical female trend . </s>
if the kid is born , she looks like a girl . </s>
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought up as a girl . </s>
but it takes mostly until you get to pu@@ ber@@ ty and your brea@@ sts grow and your brea@@ th@@ taking , but you don &apos;t get your period until someone comes to it , that there &apos;s something else there . </s>
and they do some tests , and they find out that instead of carrying bu@@ ri@@ als and u@@ ter@@ us , in reality , they actually wear a y chromo@@ some , and they have a y chromo@@ some . </s>
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person for actually male , but they &apos;re not really . </s>
women like men , in our bodies , have something called ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine gl@@ ue . </s>
they &apos;re in the back part of our bodies . </s>
and the side ki@@ dney places and@@ ro@@ gens , which are the vi@@ ri@@ li@@ ous hor@@ mon@@ es . </s>
most women , like me -- i believe a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real chromosom@@ es , but i think i probably have the typical typical -- most women -- most women like me actually speak to and@@ ro@@ gens . </s>
we produce and@@ ro@@ gen , and we speak to and@@ ro@@ gens . </s>
and the consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain that was more resili@@ ent than a woman who was born with ho@@ sti@@ le and has a and@@ ro@@ gen@@ -@@ re@@ cep@@ tor defe@@ ct . </s>
so gender is really complicated ; inter@@ sexual standing standing in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can be spread across the band@@ wid@@ th . </s>
another example : a couple of years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , he had a friend , he had a gir@@ l@@ friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend as a man , and he had just found out that he had sticks and a u@@ ter@@ us . </s>
he had an extreme form of a sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly in@@ na@@ te hyper@@ bo@@ ic hyper@@ bo@@ o . </s>
he was a x@@ x chromo@@ some , and in the wom@@ b , his side were so highly active , that they basically created a male hor@@ mon@@ es . </s>
and as a result , his gen@@ it@@ als were exposed male , and his brain was exposed to the most typical male part of the hor@@ mon@@ es of hor@@ mon@@ es . </s>
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody was looking at anything . </s>
and only when he was 19 , he received enough medical problems of medical problems , in fact , because he men@@ des the doctors that he found out that he was female . </s>
okay , just a quick example of a version of inter@@ sexu@@ ality . </s>
some people with x@@ x chromosom@@ es developed something that is called o@@ ven est@@ is , where o@@ vari@@ an tissue tissue tissue is covered in ho@@ sti@@ le tissue . </s>
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening . </s>
so gender can come up with lots and lots of different var@@ ie@@ ties of different var@@ ie@@ ties . </s>
the reason why children with this kind of body -- whether it be d@@ res@@ sing or si@@ am@@ es@@ ic tw@@ ins , be inter@@ sex@@ ually -- surge@@ ons are often adap@@ ted to the nor@@ m , because that &apos;s not because it &apos;s their physical health . </s>
in many cases , these people are completely healthy . </s>
the reason why they often have different kinds of sur@@ gical interven@@ tions is because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories . </s>
typically our system is based on the idea that a particular anatom@@ ic au@@ ction goes with a particular identity . </s>
so we have the idea that a woman is to be a female identity ; a black person is supposed to be , sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly , an african anatom@@ y in terms of their own history . </s>
so we have this terri@@ bly simpli@@ stic idea . </s>
and when we &apos;re con@@ fron@@ ted with a body that is actually very different for us , it conf@@ uses us in terms of these categ@@ ories . </s>
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture about individu@@ alism . </s>
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individu@@ alism . </s>
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , that two people are in a body . </s>
where i had experienced most of the exc@@ it@@ ement , the south african run@@ off ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya last year , whose gender asked gender cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship in berlin cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship in berlin . </s>
a lot of journ@@ alists called me to the question , &quot; what test are you going to do to tell us whether ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is female or male or male ? &quot; </s>
and i had to tell the journ@@ alists that there was no test . </s>
we know now that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t have a line for us between male and female , or between male and inter@@ sex@@ ually and soft and inter@@ sexual , we are tac@@ kl@@ ing it , of course , as natural as natural . </s>
so we have a situation , where the further our science pro@@ gr@@ esses , we need to admit that these categ@@ ories that we thought we had for stable anatom@@ ical categ@@ ories , which made very simple arr@@ ange@@ ments to create permanent identity sc@@ at@@ ories , are much more under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed than we &apos;ve imagined . </s>
and it &apos;s not just in terms of gender . </s>
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out to be much more complicated than our termin@@ ology has appro@@ ved . </s>
in our view , we have all sorts of in@@ conveni@@ ent areas . </s>
for example , we tend to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees . </s>
what are we going to do with the fact that we only diff@@ er from them through few nu@@ an@@ o@@ ti@@ des ? </s>
as we move forward our science , we &apos;re increasingly coming into a zone of dis@@ comfort , where we have to recognize that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories that we &apos;ve had are probably too simple . </s>
we see that in all sorts of human life . </s>
one of the areas that we &apos;re seeing in the examples , in our current culture , in our united states today , are the fighting over the beginning and the end of life . </s>
we have difficult conversations about what point will become a body for human beings , so that it has a different right than fe@@ tal life . </s>
we have very difficult con@@ not@@ ations today -- perhaps not as public as public as in medicine -- about the question of when someone is dead . </s>
our ancestors never had that hard to fight with the question when someone was dead . </s>
you &apos;ve only kept a fe@@ e under your nose , and when they moved , you haven &apos;t bu@@ ried them yet . </s>
if she didn &apos;t move anymore , you &apos;d bur@@ y them . </s>
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we want to take people &apos;s vital organs and re@@ produce them other people . </s>
and as a result , we &apos;re starting to fight with the really difficult question , when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult position where we don &apos;t have as simple categ@@ ories as ever before . </s>
now , you may expect that the whole categ@@ ory of categ@@ ories would make someone really happy to make me happy . </s>
i &apos;m poli@@ tically pro@@ gressi@@ ve , i def@@ end people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous . </s>
to understand that these categ@@ ories are actually much less inse@@ cure than we thought , &quot; i &apos;m concerned . &quot; </s>
and it makes me care about consider@@ ing democracy in terms of the democracy . </s>
so to tell you about this tension , i have to first know that i &apos;m a big fan of the fo@@ unding fathers . </s>
i know they were ra@@ m@@ bling , i know they were se@@ xi@@ sts , but they were great . </s>
i find that they were more bra@@ ve and strong , and so radical , in what they were doing every few years that i could see every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely for@@ gotten . </s>
it &apos;s because what happened to 17@@ 7@@ 6 happened with the fo@@ unding fathers . </s>
the fo@@ unding fathers were in my view of the original anatom@@ ical activi@@ sts , which is why . </s>
what it turned out was an anatom@@ ic concept , and they put it through a different which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us to scale . </s>
as you all remember , our fo@@ unding fathers led the concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y based on a very simpli@@ fied notion of anatom@@ y . </s>
the rul@@ ers of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the birth of the birth . </s>
they had a concept of blue blood . </s>
they were the notion that people who had political power had to have this political power because of the inher@@ ited blood line from the grandfather to the father of the son and so on . </s>
the fo@@ unding fathers pro@@ ved this idea and put them through a new anatom@@ ic concept , and this concept said that all people were created equal . </s>
they ni@@ vel@@ ated the play@@ ground , and they decided that anatom@@ ically , the simil@@ ari@@ ties were coun@@ ting , not the differences . and that was very radical . </s>
now , they did this because they were part of an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed system where two things grew together . </s>
democracy grew up , but at the same time , science grew up . </s>
if you look at the story of the fo@@ unding fathers , many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ ali@@ stic world . </s>
they went away from explan@@ ations of super@@ natural species , and things like a super@@ natural concept of power , back where the trans@@ mission is based on a very va@@ gue concept of birth of birth . </s>
they moved to a natur@@ ali@@ stic concept . </s>
and if you look at the dec@@ lar@@ ation of indepen@@ dence , they talk about nature and the god of nature . </s>
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god . </s>
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are . </s>
and as part of this , they made us a concept of anatom@@ ical common@@ alities . </s>
and so they really prepared for the future of the civil rights movement . </s>
they didn &apos;t think about it that way , but what they &apos;ve done for us was great . </s>
so what happened for years ? </s>
for example , women who used the vot@@ ing vot@@ es , the concept of the fo@@ unding fathers , that says that anatom@@ ic difference is more important than the anatom@@ ic difference , and said , &quot; that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and o@@ un@@ ce as a difference , that we shouldn &apos;t have the vot@@ ing right , the right to own full citi@@ zen@@ ship , etc . , etc . , etc . &quot; </s>
and women argu@@ ed that success@@ fully . </s>
next of all , the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like so@@ ap , who says , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot; </s>
we find men in the mar@@ row of the land@@ ing movement movement , who says , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot; </s>
again , humans , different skin color , which are based on anatom@@ ical differences in anatom@@ ical differences , again , successful . </s>
we &apos;re seeing the same in the dis@@ ability movement . </s>
of course , the problem is that , as we start looking at all the common simil@@ ari@@ ties , we have to begin to question why we have certain dis@@ abilities . </s>
well , well-@@ inten@@ tioned , i want to susta@@ in certain dis@@ abilities , anatom@@ ically , in our culture . </s>
for example , i don &apos;t want a fish to give the same rights as a human . </s>
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from anatom@@ y . </s>
i don &apos;t want to say that five year-olds should have the right to give their understanding of sex or mar@@ ry . </s>
so there are some anatom@@ ical dis@@ abilities that make sense to me , and that we think should remain . </s>
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep it , and whether it &apos;s meaningful . </s>
so , let &apos;s go back to those two creatures that have been seen at the beginning of the talk . </s>
we have two creatures , both in 197@@ 9 , voted by the same day . </s>
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , mar@@ ia , has been born three months , so she &apos;s born on the 1 june , 1980 . </s>
h@@ ein@@ rich , on the other hand , he &apos;s born to the ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment , so he &apos;s born on the 1 march of 1980 . </s>
just because of the fact that mar@@ ia was born three months earlier , she takes all the possible rights three months to h@@ ein@@ rich -- to have the right to choose sex , the right to drink right now . </s>
h@@ ein@@ rich needs to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , only based on the time of his birth . </s>
we find other od@@ di@@ ties about what their rights are . </s>
h@@ ein@@ rich , because you assume that it &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the x@@ y -- because you assume that it &apos;s male , it can be male , it can &apos;t worry about what mar@@ ia needs to worry about . </s>
but mar@@ ia , however , in all states , can &apos;t perceive the same thing , the h@@ ein@@ rich in all states , and it &apos;s right to mar@@ ry the right thing . </s>
h@@ ein@@ rich can mar@@ ry a woman in every state , but mar@@ ia can only mar@@ ry a woman today . </s>
so we have these permanent anatom@@ ical categ@@ ories that are proble@@ matic and questi@@ onable in many ways . </s>
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is making such progress in the field of anatom@@ y that we have a point where we have to admit that a democracy based on anatom@@ y might be based on anatom@@ y ? </s>
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time , it feels like science is doing self-@@ assem@@ bling . </s>
so where do we go ? </s>
it seems like our culture would take a kind of pra@@ g@@ matic post@@ ure , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got to pull a line somewhere , so we &apos;re pulling them somewhere . &quot; </s>
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position . </s>
so for instance , texas has decided to mar@@ ry a man to mar@@ ry that you don &apos;t have a y chromo@@ some , and a woman means you have a y chromo@@ some . </s>
now in practice , people are not tested in their chromo@@ some . </s>
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story that i told you about earlier , i &apos;ve been talking about the and@@ ro@@ sis . </s>
when we look at one of the fo@@ unding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin lu@@ ther king , he gives us a dream of &quot; i have a dream &quot; speech , &quot; a kind of solution . &quot; </s>
he says we shouldn &apos;t be jud@@ ged by her skin color , but jud@@ ging by the tra@@ ins of her character , and beyond anatom@@ y . </s>
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot; </s>
but how do you do that in practice ? </s>
how do you evalu@@ ate people from their characters ? </s>
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should give rights to people like this , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden re@@ tri@@ sts that probably deser@@ ve social benefits than some people i know . </s>
i &apos;d like to conclude that i know that i know some hel@@ met lab@@ el dogs are the more capable , more intelligent , more intelligent and more rich decisions about their sexual relationships than some 4@@ 0-@@ year-old i know . </s>
so how are we going to oper@@ ate the question of character &apos;s properties ? </s>
it turns out to be really difficult . </s>
and one part of me wonder , what if the content of a personality was something that would be machin@@ e-@@ read@@ able in the future -- could be done with f@@ mri visible ? </s>
do we really want to go in this direction ? </s>
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going . </s>
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to thinking about questions about democracy . </s>
in our effort for democracy , we &apos;ve done our things really well , and i think we would do our things in the future . </s>
we don &apos;t have the situation , like for example , in iran &apos;s case , where a man who feels sex@@ ually drawn to other men will be pun@@ ished with death , unless he &apos;s willing to under@@ go a gender shift in which case he can stay alive . </s>
these kinds of things don &apos;t exist in us . </s>
i &apos;m very happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon i spoke to a few years ago , who had some si@@ am@@ es@@ ian tw@@ ins coming in to separate them , par@@ tly to make a name . </s>
but when i was working with him , and he asked him why he made these interven@@ tions -- they were very ris@@ ky sur@@ ger@@ ies -- his answer was that in his country , these children would be treated very bad@@ ly , and therefore he had to do it . </s>
and i said to him , &quot; well , do you have political as@@ y@@ l in consider@@ ation rather than an operation to separate them ? &quot; </s>
the united states is providing incredible opportunities for allowing people to be the ones that they are , without change in the state of state . </s>
that &apos;s why i think we need to be leaders . </s>
well , just to finish , i want to see that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers . </s>
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or looked out , if we had the mothers more involved . </s>
and i want to say something that is radical for a femin@@ ist is a little bit radical , and i think that there might be different ways that there might be different kinds of insi@@ ghts that come from different kinds of anatom@@ y , especially when people apply a group thinking . </s>
for years , because i was interested in inter@@ sexu@@ ality , i &apos;ve been interested in research in the field of gender . </s>
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and interact in the world . </s>
what we &apos;ve learned from cross-@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive studies is that women , on average -- not all , but on average -- more likely to give up complex social relationships and care for people who are vulnerable to the group , who are very , very much attention . </s>
and so , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us . </s>
years ago , when i was a graduate student , one of my students asked me , who knew my interest in femin@@ ism -- i considered myself a femin@@ ist , and i looked at it as a femin@@ ist -- a really curious question . </s>
he said , &quot; tell me what the femin@@ ism is female . &quot; </s>
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dum@@ best question i &apos;ve ever heard . </s>
femin@@ ism is about solving stereot@@ yp@@ es about gender , which is why femin@@ ism is not female . </s>
but the more i thought about his question , so more so i thought there might be some female in femin@@ ism . </s>
that is to say , there may be something , on average , female brains of male brains are different from male relationships for highly complex social relationships , and paying attention to the prote@@ ctive nee@@ ding . </s>
so where the green fathers were extremely concerned to find out how individuals could be protected in front of the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers into this concept , we get a concept of che@@ cking , not just how to protect , but how we can care for each other . </s>
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future when we take democracy out of anatom@@ y -- think less about the individual body thinking about identity , and think about relationships of relationships . </s>
so that when we try to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other . </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case . </s>
but before i show you what i have in there , i &apos;m going to do a very public conf@@ ession , and that is : i &apos;m obsessed with out@@ puts . </s>
i love to find a different color@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit of crazy out@@ fit out@@ fit out@@ fits , and blog@@ ging at the last time . </s>
but i don &apos;t buy anything new . </s>
i get all my clothes from two hand in f@@ loo@@ ds , and i get a big hand@@ -@@ hand@@ -@@ shops . </s>
ooh , thank you . </s>
i can &apos;t allow you to reduce the impact of my gar@@ den@@ o@@ ve to the environment and also the pur@@ ch@@ asing pur@@ ch@@ ases . </s>
i meet all kinds of amazing people ; my dollars ser@@ ves for usually a good cause ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes shopping to my very personal back@@ up search . </s>
i mean , what am i going to find today ? </s>
is it going to be my size ? </s>
am i going to like the paint ? </s>
will it cost less than 20 dollars ? </s>
when all the answers come out , i feel like i &apos;ve won . </s>
i come back to my su@@ it@@ case , and i tell you what i pac@@ ked here for this exciting week at ted . </s>
i mean , what does anybody bring in with so many out@@ puts ? </s>
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i &apos;ve come with . </s>
i brought seven pair of under@@ pants , and that &apos;s all . </s>
sub@@ si@@ dies to exactly one week , anything i did in my su@@ it@@ case . </s>
i &apos;ve bet that i would maybe wear anything i might wear when i first came to palm spr@@ ings . </s>
and since you &apos;ve not heard of me as the woman going around here at ted in her under@@ wear -- this is what i mean , i found a couple of things . </s>
and i really want to show you my out@@ fit for this week . </s>
does that sound good ? </s>
as i do this , i &apos;m going to leave you with some of the lessons that i believe whether you believe it or not , learned from these ad@@ vent@@ ures , not to have anything new . </s>
let &apos;s start with sun@@ day . </s>
i call this the radi@@ ant tiger . </s>
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking at great . </s>
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars . </s>
this whole out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket , cost me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week . </s>
mon@@ day : color is a bit powerful . </s>
it &apos;s almost physi@@ ologically impossible to be bad if you &apos;re wearing light red pants . </s>
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re raising other happy people . </s>
tu@@ es@@ day : adap@@ tation is totally over@@ r@@ ated . </s>
i &apos;ve spent a lot of my life trying to be myself , and adapt to me at the same time . </s>
just be who you are . </s>
when they surro@@ und themselves with the right people , they won &apos;t just understand it ; they will appreciate it . </s>
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : embrace your inner child . </s>
sometimes people tell me , i feel like i remember d@@ res@@ sing games , or i remember them on their se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-olds . </s>
i like s@@ mil@@ ing and say , &quot; thank you . &quot; </s>
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : confidence is the key . </s>
if you think you &apos;re looking in a little bit good , it &apos;s almost certainly like that . </s>
and if you think you &apos;re not good at something , you &apos;re probably right . </s>
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for a day . </s>
but only when i turned 30 , i really understood what that means . </s>
and i &apos;ll sum@@ mar@@ ize that for you . </s>
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and out of a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear . </s>
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody in this audience here . </s>
we should be able to ro@@ tate everything we want . </s>
thank you . </s>
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words : golden pa@@ il@@ ts adapt to everything . </s>
and finally , satur@@ day : a unique , unique , personal way to develop , is a great way to tell the world something about one , without having to say a word . </s>
it has been pro@@ ven to me again and again , when people got to me this week , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations . </s>
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit in my tiny su@@ it@@ case . </s>
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;ll don@@ ate all of that back . </s>
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to learn from this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go . </s>
i don &apos;t have to put these things emotion@@ ally , because right around the corner , it &apos;s always going to give another crazy , color@@ ful out@@ standing out@@ fit , that will only be waiting for me to love a little bit in the heart and find it . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
thank you . </s>
good afternoon , everybody together . </s>
i &apos;ve got something here that i &apos;d like to show you . </s>
think of that as a visual point , as a flying image . </s>
this is what we call in our lab , per@@ cep@@ tual design . </s>
let me tell you a little bit about it . </s>
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m origin@@ ally itali@@ an , and every boy in it@@ aly grows up with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that in the formul@@ a one in the last couple decades has happened something very interesting . </s>
some time ago , it was like , if you wanted to win a formul@@ a a race , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car . </s>
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race . </s>
now no@@ wa@@ days , if you want to win a race , you actually want something like this -- something like this -- something that has monit@@ ored the car in real time , a few thousand sensors , the information from the car , that information to the system , and then process it , and then use that car to send decisions back and change things in real time while information is collected . </s>
this would call you , in engineering teams , a re@@ al-@@ time control system . </s>
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made out of two parts -- a sen@@ ti@@ ent part and a respond part of it . </s>
what &apos;s interesting now is that the re@@ al-@@ time control systems begin to appear in our lives . </s>
our cities have been equi@@ pped in the last few years just with networks and electronics . </s>
they become computers in the open . </s>
and as a computer in the free , you start to react in different ways , and they are percei@@ ved , and they &apos;re driven . </s>
when we make cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal . </s>
by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population lives there . </s>
they &apos;re 75 percent of energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of the co2 emissions . </s>
so if we can do something about cities , that &apos;s a big deal . </s>
in addition to the cities , all of that pul@@ ses and pul@@ ls in objects in the objects of the everyday life . </s>
this is from an exhibition that pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i for mom@@ a later in the year , organized during the summer . </s>
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot; </s>
well , all of our objects , our environment , are starting to speak back to us . </s>
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom is out there , a sensor and an oper@@ ator . </s>
and this changes radi@@ cally the interaction that we have with people around our environment . </s>
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ... </s>
you know , when mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o formed the mo@@ ses , it means that he took the ham@@ mer at the end and thre@@ w it on mo@@ ses -- in fact , they can still see a little spot -- and said , &quot; per@@ ch@@ é n@@ on par@@ é ? why don &apos;t you go ? &quot; </s>
well , today , our environment starts to respond to us for the first time . </s>
i &apos;m just going to show you a few examples -- again , again , with the idea of percei@@ ving our environment . </s>
let &apos;s start with percei@@ ving that . </s>
now the first project i want to show you is really one of the first of our labs . </s>
it came about four and a half years ago in it@@ aly . </s>
and what we &apos;ve done is actually using a new kind of network that &apos;s been used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone web -- and anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated information from this network , which will be collected from the oper@@ ators to understand how the city works . </s>
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 . </s>
it was when it@@ aly won the football world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship . </s>
some of you remember , it was when it@@ aly played against france , and then at the end of the zi@@ dan@@ e , the head . </s>
and anyway , it@@ aly has won at the end . </s>
now , look at what happened this day , just in the activity of the activity that happens in the network . </s>
here you see the city . </s>
you can see in the center of the colo@@ s@@ se@@ um , the flying ti@@ ber ti@@ ber . </s>
in the morning , before the game . </s>
you &apos;re looking at the ti@@ mel@@ ine at the top . </s>
in the past afternoon , people here and there , making calls and moving . </s>
the game starts on -- silence . </s>
france is doing a tor . it@@ aly makes a tor . </s>
se@@ vent@@ h time , people make a short call , go to the toilet . </s>
second se@@ ven@@ -@@ time . end of the normal game . </s>
first lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty , second . </s>
zi@@ dan@@ e , in a moment of the head . </s>
it@@ aly w@@ ins . yeah . </s>
well , at that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate . </s>
they saw the big impact . </s>
the next day , everyone went to the center to meet the vic@@ tor@@ ian team and the prime minister at the same time . </s>
and then everybody went down . </s>
you can see the picture of the place cir@@ cular cir@@ co , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate people -- to have a big party , and they see the impact at the end of the day . </s>
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do a few years ago . </s>
quickly , another example of feeling : this is not about people , but about things that we use and consume . </s>
well today , we know all about where our things are from . </s>
this is a map that shows you all the chips from which a ma@@ c computer is made of how they got together . </s>
but we just know little about where the things go . </s>
so in this project we actually designed some small mark@@ ers to pur@@ sue the garbage as they go through the system . </s>
so we started with some volunteers that helped us , a little more than a year ago , in seattle , tag@@ ged the things that they were thro@@ wing -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that you would throw away anyway . </s>
and then we have these little chips , the little br@@ ands , and we put them on the garbage and we started tracking them . </s>
so here are the results that we &apos;ve gotten right now . </s>
from seattle ... </s>
after a week . </s>
with this information , we realized that there are a lot of in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies in the system . </s>
we can make the same things actually with less energy . </s>
the data was not available before . </s>
but this is what happens to a lot of un@@ useful transpor@@ ting and complicated things . </s>
the other thing is , we believe that when we see every day that the cup we throw away every day , it doesn &apos;t just go away that it &apos;s still on the planet somewhere . </s>
and the plastic bottle , which we &apos;re still thro@@ wing every day . </s>
and if we show that to people , then we can drive a behavior change . </s>
so that &apos;s the reason for this project . </s>
my colleague at the mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , could see you much more about the sense and the many other wonderful things that you can perceive , but i &apos;d like to talk to you about the second part that we discus@@ sed in the beginning , and that is the em@@ phas@@ is in our environment . </s>
and the first project is something we did a few years ago in zar@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in . </s>
and it began with a question of the ma@@ yor who came to us and said that spa@@ in and southern europe had a beautiful tradition to use water in public places as part of the architecture . </s>
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology ? </s>
and one of the ideas that was sub@@ mit@@ ted to work on a piece of labor was , imagine these tu@@ bes , and val@@ ves , mag@@ net val@@ ves , val@@ ves that open and clo@@ sing . </s>
they &apos;re creating something like a water pro@@ pos@@ al in water . </s>
and when these images fall down , you can write on it , you can display patterns , images , text . </s>
and you can approach it , and it will open up to let you go through as you can see in this picture . </s>
well , we introduced the ma@@ yor of bel@@ hole . </s>
he loved it very much . </s>
and we got the assign@@ ment to design a building at the exp@@ o of the exp@@ o . </s>
we called it the digital water pa@@ stor lion . </s>
the whole building was made of water . </s>
there are no doors or windows , but when they approach it , it will open and leave it in . </s>
the roof was covered with water as well . </s>
and if it &apos;s win@@ dy , if you want to reduce the inje@@ ction , you can even leave the roof down . </s>
or you could close the building and get the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , this days , when you go down the roof , you get images of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot; </s>
no , they didn &apos;t break the building ; it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappe@@ ars . </s>
so here &apos;s how the building works . </s>
you can see the person wondering what &apos;s going on . </s>
and here you see me , when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water , didn &apos;t get we@@ t . </s>
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors happened to work . </s>
but actually , it was an even more fun that night . </s>
all the children from zar@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different . </s>
no longer a building that would open up to make it , but a building that had still breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump now without getting we@@ t . </s>
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as an architect , engineers , as a designer , we &apos;re always thinking about how people are using things that we &apos;re designing . </s>
but the reality is always un@@ predictable . </s>
and that &apos;s the nice thing about creating things that are used and interacting with people . </s>
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical images , the visual points of water and the proje@@ ctions on it . </s>
and this is what made us think about the following project that i &apos;m showing you now . </s>
imagine these data points could really start to fly . </s>
imagine , you could have little heli@@ cop@@ ters flying through the air , and each of you with a little bit of a picture with changed light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room through the room . </s>
here &apos;s the video . </s>
imagine a heli@@ cop@@ ter , like the one you saw earlier , which moves with others , completely synchr@@ oni@@ zed . </s>
you can have this cloud . </s>
you can have some kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a regular formation of formation in two dimensions . </s>
or ir@@ regular , but in three dimensions , where what changes is the light , not the position of the visual points . </s>
they can play with different kinds of ways . </s>
so imagine the screen could just appear in different forma@@ ts or si@@ zes in different ways in different ways . </s>
but then it could be just a 3d cloud of visual points that you can go through and move through that that you can see from many , many directions . </s>
what you &apos;re looking at here is a real fl@@ y@@ y tax that goes down to shape how to form a regular v . </s>
if you turn the lights on , it looks like this , but the same as we &apos;ve seen it before . </s>
imagine that every single one of people is controlled by people . </s>
it could have a impul@@ se of every single visual point that comes from people , from the movements of the people or the same . </s>
i &apos;m going to show you something here first . </s>
we worked with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of the best bal@@ let dan@@ cers of our time -- the é@@ toi@@ le at the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan theater in new york and the sc@@ an -- we took his movements in 3d to use them as the impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fire . </s>
this is ro@@ ber@@ to dance . </s>
on the left-@@ hand side , you see the visu@@ als , the different pe@@ aks of each other . </s>
it &apos;s a real re@@ al-@@ time 3d scan and a movement scan at the same time . </s>
so they can understand the whole movement . </s>
you can do it all the time . </s>
but then , once we have all the visual points , you can play with it , and play gravity with color and move . </s>
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fire . </s>
let me show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on . </s>
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olymp@@ ics in london . </s>
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud . </s>
and the idea is , again , imagine this , imagine that we engage people to do something and change the environment -- almost like we call it , we call it cloud movement , how to move a sche@@ me , but with a cloud . </s>
imagine that everyone can give a small don@@ ation to a point of view . </s>
i think that the remarkable one of the last years , the last decades , is that we are swit@@ ched from a physical world to a digital world . </s>
it has all di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed , knowledge , and makes it available to the internet . </s>
today , for the first time , we can for the first time -- and the campaign ob@@ am@@ as showed that -- we can change from the digital world , from the self-@@ organizing forces of the physical world to the physical world . </s>
this can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol . </s>
this is something that is built in the city . </s>
but tomorrow , to make us the next challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how do we then change from the digital world to the physical world . </s>
so the idea is that we actually engage the people in which they do things together , colle@@ ctively . </s>
the cloud is again a cloud of images , in the same way that a real cloud is a cloud of particles . </s>
and those particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of images . </s>
it &apos;s a physical form in london , but covered with visual points . </s>
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences . </s>
you can actually look at them from below , sharing the most important moments for olymp@@ ia and trans@@ mission , and using it as a kind of connection to the community . </s>
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top you can go , like london &apos;s new mountain pe@@ aks . </s>
you can walk in . </s>
and sort of a digital glo@@ w tower at night -- but as the most important , a new kind of experience for anyone who wants to go to the top . </s>
thank you . </s>
as an artist , the relationship is very important . </s>
through my work , i try to express that people are not separated from nature , and that everything is connected to each other . </s>
the first time i was in ant@@ arc@@ tica in ant@@ arc@@ tica , where i saw my first ic@@ e@@ berg . </s>
i get a@@ we a@@ we . </s>
my heart rate , i was s@@ hal@@ low , as i was trying to gras@@ p what was in front of me . </s>
the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs ra@@ mp@@ ed around me 60 feet from the water , and i was able to wonder that this was a sno@@ w@@ fla@@ ke on another sno@@ w@@ fla@@ ke , year after year . </s>
ic@@ e@@ ber@@ es are born as cal@@ m from a gl@@ aci@@ er or by breaking out ice she@@ ets . </s>
every ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual personality . </s>
they interact in a unique way with their surro@@ und@@ ings and their experiences . </s>
some ref@@ use to give up and cl@@ inging to the bit@@ ter end , while others don &apos;t stop and collapse in a dramatic and dramatic sense . </s>
when you look at an ic@@ e@@ berg , you think they &apos;re easily isol@@ ated , separated and alone , just as we see people often see us . </s>
but the truth is far apart . </s>
as an ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , i breathe its ancient atmosphere . </s>
and during the ic@@ e@@ berg , it mel@@ ts miner@@ al drinking water that fe@@ eds a lot of life . </s>
i &apos;m going to go through my photographs of these ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs as if i &apos;m making portraits of my ancestors , in the sense that they exist in these individual moments , and they &apos;re never going to exist again . </s>
it &apos;s not a death , if it &apos;s mel@@ ting ; it &apos;s not an end , but it &apos;s a pro@@ gression of her path of life cycle . </s>
part of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ fall that i photograph is very young -- a few thousand years old . </s>
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old . </s>
so the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is an ic@@ e@@ berg that i photographed in ke@@ ker@@ t@@ sou@@ ak in green@@ land . </s>
very rarely , you will actually see a rolling ic@@ e@@ berg . </s>
and this is what you see . </s>
on the left-@@ hand side , you see a little boat . </s>
this is about five meters long . </s>
i want you to watch the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg , and where it &apos;s in the water line . </s>
you can see here he &apos;s starting to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there . </s>
that &apos;s the average size of a green@@ land ic@@ e@@ berg . </s>
it &apos;s about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters of the water . </s>
and this video is real time . </s>
and just this , the ic@@ e@@ berg tells you another side of his personality . </s>
thank you . </s>
my life is really extra@@ ordin@@ arily bl@@ essed by work on some amazing projects . </s>
but for the cool@@ est thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was this guy . </s>
his name is temp@@ t . </s>
temp@@ t was one of the leading gra@@ ff@@ iti artists of the 198@@ 0s . </s>
then one day , he came back from the walk and said , &quot; pa@@ ps , my legs cryst@@ al . &quot; </s>
and that was the out@@ break of it . </s>
temp@@ t is completely paraly@@ zed today . </s>
he can only use his eyes . </s>
i was facing him . </s>
i have a company that makes design and anima@@ tions , so gra@@ ff@@ iti is a complex part of what we admi@@ re and pay attention to the art world . </s>
so we decided , tony -- temp@@ t -- and suppor@@ ted his cause . </s>
i met with his father and his brother , and i said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money . </s>
what are you going to do with this ? &quot; </s>
and his brother said , &quot; i want to just talk to tony again . </s>
i just want to just start with him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , this isn &apos;t -- i saw stephen haw@@ king -- can &apos;t all the paraly@@ zed people communicate with these devices ? &quot; </s>
and he said , &quot; no , just when you &apos;re hearing the higher social layer and have a remarkable insurance , you can really do it . </s>
ordinary people are not accessible to these devices . &quot; </s>
and i said , &quot; well , how does it communicate ? &quot; </s>
anybody saw the movie &apos; bu@@ tter@@ fly and pi@@ ck@@ le bell ? &quot; </s>
this is how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers walk along . </s>
i said , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ ic , how could that be ? &quot; </s>
so i came up with the need to just just ask a check , and instead i asked a check , which i didn &apos;t have the most app@@ all@@ ing idea of how to fix it . </s>
i com@@ mit myself to his brother and his father -- and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my sugge@@ stion is , &quot; well , my sugge@@ stion , tony &apos;s going to talk , we &apos;ll get him a machine , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can do his art again . </s>
because it &apos;s a far@@ ce that somebody who &apos;s carrying it still can &apos;t communicate it . &quot; </s>
so i spoke at a conference a few months later . </s>
i met these people from gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then draw on a laser poin@@ ter that gover@@ ns just the negative area . </s>
so they &apos;re pulling around and doing art instal@@ lations like this . </s>
they &apos;re saying that all the things that are being put up there are a life cycle . </s>
it starts with gender , and then the bad words come after the bush , the bush publi@@ sh@@ er , and people are actually doing art , and people are actually doing art . </s>
but there was always a life cycle in their pres@@ ent@@ ations . </s>
so i went home , and i ate with my wife and told her everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology , if you can use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way that temp@@ t can drive a laser , so that he can make gra@@ ff@@ iti again , that would be great . &quot; </s>
that was the beginning of the journey . </s>
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot and a lot of things , we &apos;ve achieved some things . </s>
one , we put the insurance down the doors , and we actually got a device for temp@@ t that he can communicate with -- a stephen haw@@ king machine . </s>
this was amazing . </s>
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yo@@ da , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so un@@ comfortable , this guy is incredible . &quot; </s>
we also flew seven programm@@ ers from all over the world -- literally from all the cor@@ ners of the world -- to us home . </s>
my wife , my kids and i were pulled into the garage , and these hacker and programm@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ racy physi@@ ci@@ sts have taken over our house . </s>
a lot of our friends thought we were pretty stupid to do that , and that we got back and we would go back and all the images on the walls would be gra@@ ff@@ iti . </s>
but for over two weeks , we programm@@ ed , we went to the street project in ven@@ ice , my kids were brought up , and we created my dog , and we created this . </s>
it &apos;s called eye@@ com , and you can see the descri@@ ption . </s>
this is a cheap sun@@ glasses that we &apos;ve bought on the beach of ven@@ ice , some cop@@ per wire and some stuff out of the building market and the electronics . </s>
we took a p@@ s@@ three camera , they diver@@ ged it , they put it on an led light , and now we have a device that is fre@@ ely available -- you can build it yourself , we put the code free , the software can down@@ load you for free . </s>
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of limit@@ ations . </s>
no insurance can be created . </s>
no hospital either . </s>
each paraly@@ zed can actually communicate or draw with his eyes alone . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you so much , that was incredible . </s>
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back in the temp@@ le room . </s>
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room . </s>
and there &apos;s all this no@@ il back in front of the great re@@ vel@@ ation . </s>
and after a year of planning , two weeks of progra@@ mming , nu@@ del@@ ines and per@@ formed ni@@ ghts , tony drew the first time after seven years . </s>
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking at his life support system . </s>
we put his bed down his bed so he can see outside . </s>
we hi@@ red a proje@@ ctor against a wall of the parking lot before the hospital . </s>
and he drew again , for the first time , in both his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was in the parking lot . </s>
lu@@ ck@@ ily , we had to break down in the parking lot , so we felt really as a part of the spra@@ y scene . </s>
and in the end , he sent us an email email : &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve recorded something for the first time . </s>
i felt that i was pus@@ hed under water , and finally someone attac@@ ked down and raised my head so that i could breathe . &quot; </s>
isn &apos;t that mind-@@ blo@@ wing ? </s>
it &apos;s something like our cam@@ el scre@@ am . </s>
that keeps us out of time , and keep going on . </s>
and we have to do a lot of progress on this device . </s>
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes from a magic board in the same way . </s>
and somebody who has an artistic potential , deser@@ ves so much more . </s>
so we &apos;re in finding out how to make it better , faster and stronger . </s>
since that time , we &apos;ve received all sorts of recognition . </s>
we &apos;ve won some a@@ wards . </s>
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deser@@ ve it . </s>
it all comes from our own po@@ ckets . </s>
so the exc@@ uses were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot; </s>
arm@@ strong twi@@ tter@@ ed to us and then , in dec@@ ember , hon@@ ored us the ti@@ me-@@ magazine , as one of the 50 great inven@@ tions of 2010 , which was really ne@@ at . </s>
the cool@@ est thing is -- and this includes the whole circle -- that it &apos;s this april mo@@ ca mo@@ ca in the inner city of los angeles called an exhibition called &quot; type of the streets . &quot; </s>
and there &apos;s probably pretty much the har@@ dest represent@@ a@@ tives of the street scene sitting there -- bank@@ ers , she@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y , ca@@ ws -- all these boys are going to be there . </s>
temp@@ t is going to be part of the show , which is pretty expensive . </s>
so basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s impossible , then you can do it . </s>
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this micro@@ phone , the eye@@ ball -- everything was impossible at some point . </s>
make it possible -- you all here . </s>
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , and i haven &apos;t had anything to do with au@@ tu@@ re-@@ engineering technology , but i &apos;ve just captured something and surrounded me with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs together . </s>
and that question should ask each of you , and every single day that you ask them to do something that has to be done , if not now , when then ? and if i don &apos;t , who then ? </s>
thank you . </s>
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most e@@ aten child writer . </s>
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to get a scientist like that . </s>
you can have me as a farmer , or in lea@@ ther , but nobody has ever chosen farmers . </s>
today i want to tell you about circles and re@@ vel@@ ations . </s>
well , an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment is usually something that you find it because you &apos;ve dropped it somewhere else . </s>
you go around the block , and you take it as a re@@ vel@@ ation . </s>
this is a painting of a circle . </s>
one of my friends has done it -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ er . </s>
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;d like to share with you today . </s>
my circle started back in the &apos; 60s at high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o , where i was the classroom . </s>
i was the one who was be@@ aten every week at the ju@@ ven@@ ile green and blue , until a teacher saved my life . </s>
she saved my life by using the toilet in the classroom room . </s>
she did that secre@@ tly . </s>
she did it for three years . </s>
and i had to go away from the city . </s>
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 85 dollars , and it hit me to san francisco in california -- i found a lo@@ ver -- and then back in the &apos; 80s , i found it very important for a job in aids organizations . </s>
about three or four years ago , i was given a call in the middle of the night from this teacher , woman post post , who said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to see them . </s>
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults . </s>
can you please come to o@@ hi@@ o , and please come together with the guy that i know that you &apos;ve found by now . </s>
and i should mention that i have pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , and i want you to hur@@ ry . &quot; </s>
well , the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and . </s>
we looked at them , we laugh@@ ed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew they had to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce . </s>
we found one for them , we brought them up , and we took care of them , and we gave on their family eight , because it was necessary . </s>
it was something that we knew . </s>
and just as the woman who was familiar with me as an adult , she met me , she turned into a box full of a@@ we , and was put in my hands . </s>
and what happened was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the re@@ vel@@ ation i was talking about . </s>
the re@@ vel@@ ation is that death is a part of life . </s>
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her . </s>
and you know , this part of life needs anything that takes the rest of life . </s>
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this has been mentioned so many times today . </s>
it needs the same -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about giving us these things . </s>
thank you . </s>
imagine a large explosion as they go up to 1,000 meters . </s>
imagine a plane full of smoke . </s>
imagine a power station , the so@@ cket , the so@@ cket , the so@@ cket , the so@@ cket , the so@@ ck , the so@@ le , the so@@ ck . </s>
this sounds terri@@ bly cor@@ related . </s>
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on 1@@ d . </s>
i was the only one who could speak to the air@@ planes . </s>
so i looked at them in the same way , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught some birds . &quot; </s>
the pilot had turned it on , and we were not that far away . </s>
you could see manhattan . </s>
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time . </s>
the pilot set out the machine to the hu@@ d@@ son river . </s>
it &apos;s usually not the route . </s>
he swit@@ ches down the tu@@ bes . </s>
imagine a sound of a sound . </s>
and then he said three words -- the most interesting words i &apos;ve ever heard . </s>
he says , &quot; choose to wake up . &quot; </s>
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the party person anymore . </s>
i could see it in their eyes , there was hor@@ ror , the life was hor@@ ror . </s>
so i want to share with you three things i &apos;ve learned about that day on this day . </s>
i learned that in a moment , everything is different . </s>
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to make a hand and it didn &apos;t do , all the f@@ ences i wanted to rock , all the experiences i wanted to do and never did . </s>
while i was thinking about this , i noticed a phrase , which is , &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad w@@ ells . &quot; </s>
because when the wine is there , and the person is there , i open it . </s>
i will never move anything in life anymore . </s>
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that goal , really changed my life . </s>
the second thing i learned that day -- and that was when we missed the george washington bridge , so much of hair -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really regre@@ t . </s>
i had a good life . </s>
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i as@@ pi@@ red to be better in everything i pac@@ ked . </s>
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego room . </s>
and i took the time , which i wa@@ sted for meaning@@ less things , with people who mean something . </s>
and i was thinking about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people . </s>
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban@@ ish negative energy from my life . </s>
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better . </s>
i didn &apos;t have contro@@ versi@@ al for two years with my wife . </s>
it feels great . </s>
i &apos;m not trying to get right ; i decide to be happy . </s>
the third thing i learned -- and that &apos;s when the inner watch starts , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , ... &quot; </s>
you see the water coming out . </s>
i said , &quot; please wake up in the air . &quot; </s>
i don &apos;t want this thing in 20 parts , as you know it from docum@@ ent@@ aries . </s>
while we crash@@ ed , i had this sense of dying , not terri@@ fying . </s>
almost as if we were prepar@@ ing our lives for a long time . </s>
but it was very sad . </s>
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life . </s>
and that sa@@ dness really changed in one thought , which is that i only wish one thing . </s>
i just wish i could see my children growing up . </s>
and about a month later , i went to see a performance of my daughter -- first gra@@ der , not a lot of artistic talent . </s>
not yet . </s>
and i celebrate , i cry like a little kid . </s>
and in the world , everything made a sense of me . </s>
i realized then by connecting the dots with each other , that it &apos;s just about being a great father . </s>
more than anything , anything else , my only goal in life is to be a good father . </s>
i didn &apos;t have the wonder to die that day . </s>
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and live differently . </s>
my call to all the people who are flying today is : imagine that the same happens on your flight -- please not -- but imagine , and how would you change ? </s>
what would you do that you put up because you think you &apos;d be there for forever ? </s>
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ? </s>
and more than anything else , are you the best parents that you can only be ? </s>
thank you . </s>
the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is pretty straig@@ ht@@ forward . </s>
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb . </s>
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the ur@@ ani@@ um in@@ cen@@ tive facility . </s>
the gray boxes that you see here are re@@ al-@@ time control systems . </s>
so if we can now com@@ mit the systems to com@@ mit the systems that control numbers and val@@ ves , then we can actually create a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge . </s>
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology . </s>
but if we can do it , an effective win@@ dow@@ s-@@ virus virus po@@ pped on a laptop , which is used by a warm engineer to con@@ tain this gray box , we &apos;re in the business . </s>
and this is the planning behind stu@@ x@@ net . </s>
so , we start with a win@@ dow@@ s-@@ dr@@ um . </s>
the user data is trans@@ fer@@ red into the gray box , dama@@ ging the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and the irani@@ an nuclear power program -- mission com@@ mission . </s>
this is a kid &apos;s game , right ? </s>
i want to tell you how we found that . </s>
when we started stu@@ x@@ ating our research six months ago , completely unknown , which was the meaning of this con@@ struc@@ ting . </s>
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the windows part , the dro@@ ple@@ t portion , it was made by coun@@ t@@ less s@@ wal@@ lows of day@@ time s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wing . </s>
and it seemed that there were something with those gray boxes , these re@@ al-@@ time control systems . </s>
this attra@@ cted our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stu@@ x@@ net , and we studied this one . </s>
and then something funny happened . </s>
stu@@ x@@ net held himself like a lab that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ing it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it . </s>
that made no sense of sense in my eyes . </s>
and after we had experim@@ ented with different kinds of che@@ ese , i realized this was a tar@@ ge@@ ted attack . </s>
completely focused on a particular goal . </s>
the dro@@ ple@@ t stri@@ kes ac@@ com@@ mo@@ date on the gray box , when a particular con@@ figu@@ ration was discovered , even if the particular program is trying to infe@@ ct it on this goal . </s>
and if you don &apos;t , then stu@@ x@@ net is not going to do anything . </s>
so , that really fli@@ pped my interest , and we started working on it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the target is . </s>
it could say , for example , a high-@@ american power station , or a chemical plant in germany . </s>
so we should better find out what the goal is . </s>
so we extra@@ cted and de@@ com@@ posed the ang@@ ular code and found that it &apos;s re@@ stor@@ ed into two digital war@@ heads -- a smaller one and a bigger one . </s>
and we also noticed that they were very professional , of people who had obviously available all the insi@@ ghts to all of the insi@@ ghts . </s>
they knew all sorts of bits and by@@ lations that they needed to attack . </s>
they probably knew the band@@ -@@ size size of the machine . </s>
so they knew everything . </s>
and if you &apos;ve already heard that the dr@@ one of stu@@ x@@ net is complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you , the user data is a science for itself . </s>
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen . </s>
here &apos;s an ex@@ cer@@ pt from this ang@@ ular code code . </s>
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15@@ ,000 lines of code . </s>
looks like this , the ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned no@@ is@@ y language . </s>
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smart out of this code . </s>
so what we first saw was , what we were looking for was system function , because we know what they &apos;re doing . </s>
and then we looked for wor@@ ms and data structures and trying to bring them together with the real world -- with potential goals in the real world . </s>
so we needed theor@@ ies about these goals that we could bring or dis@@ rupt . </s>
in order to make these theor@@ ies , we remind ourselves that it &apos;s definitely about high-@@ level sab@@ ot@@ age , it has to act on a high-@@ end goal , and very likely it is in iran , because most of the infe@@ ctions have been reported . </s>
well , there are not several thousand tar@@ gets in this area . </s>
basically , it runs out on the ads of nuclear power plant , and it &apos;s the in@@ cen@@ tive system in nat@@ asha . </s>
so i said to my assi@@ stant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts in cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and power plants from our cli@@ ent tri@@ be . &quot; </s>
and i called them up and i tap into their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and in the data . </s>
and this worked very well . </s>
well , it was possible to bring the little digital war@@ ning to connect with the ro@@ ds . </s>
so the ro@@ tor is this sort of moving part of the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , this black object that you see . </s>
and if you manipu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ tor , then you can actually cra@@ ck the ro@@ tor , and then you even even have the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ ded . </s>
what we also found is that the goal of the attack was actually , it was slow and in@@ san@@ e -- obviously in the trying to make war@@ fare engineers , so that they would not be able to get behind it quickly . </s>
the big digital war@@ ning -- we got a gli@@ mp@@ se from looking at data and data structures and data structures . </s>
so , for example , number 16@@ 4 comes out of this code ; you can &apos;t over@@ see it . </s>
i began to work on scientific literature about how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge was built in nat@@ asha , and found that they &apos;re struc@@ tured in what &apos;s called cas@@ ca@@ des , and every cas@@ ca@@ de has 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge . </s>
so this made sense , it fit together . </s>
and it got better than that . </s>
these cent@@ r@@ als in iran are divided into 15 so-called levels . </s>
and guess what we found in the ang@@ ular code ? </s>
it &apos;s an almost identical structure . </s>
so again , the fit fit really well . </s>
and this gave us a great confidence in the way that we studied here . </s>
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it wasn &apos;t just like that . </s>
these results have been achieved through several weeks of hard work . </s>
and many times we just ran into a dead g@@ unk , and we had to re@@ cover . </s>
anyway , what we found was that both digital war@@ heads were actually head@@ ing towards one and the same goal , but from different directions . </s>
the little head takes over a cas@@ ca@@ de , sp@@ inning the ro@@ tors and slo@@ ws it down and slo@@ ws the big head with six cas@@ ca@@ des in interaction and manipu@@ late val@@ ves . </s>
so , in large and whole , we &apos;re very confi@@ dent that we actually have what the target is . </s>
it &apos;s nat@@ al@@ ance and it &apos;s just nat@@ al@@ ness . </s>
so we don &apos;t have to worry about other goals from stu@@ x@@ net . </s>
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- i was really blo@@ wn out of the so@@ cks . </s>
down there is the gray box , and on top of that you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge . </s>
now what this thing is doing is that it takes the underlying values of sensors -- so for example , printing sensors and vibra@@ tion sensors -- and it &apos;s making legiti@@ mate code code , which is still on the attack , with wr@@ in@@ kl@@ ing data . </s>
and in fact , this is the wrong data by stu@@ x@@ net data on stu@@ x@@ net . </s>
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where during the pur@@ suit of tracking the sur@@ vei@@ llan@@ ce camera is fed with previ@@ ously up@@ date video pictures . </s>
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ? </s>
now the idea of this is obviously not just the machine oper@@ ators in the control room . </s>
in fact , it &apos;s even more dangerous and more aggressi@@ ve . </s>
the idea is to ex@@ ec@@ ute a digital security system . </s>
we need digital security systems there , where a human machine can &apos;t respond fast enough . </s>
so in a power station , for example , when the great ste@@ am tur@@ bine gets too fast , you have to open up de@@ ple@@ tion val@@ ves within milli@@ seconds . </s>
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader . </s>
so at this point , we need digital security systems . </s>
and if those are en@@ danger@@ ed , then the really bad things can happen . </s>
the power plant can explo@@ de . </s>
and neither the machine leaders , nor the security system will notice it . </s>
this is frighten@@ ing . </s>
but it gets worse . </s>
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important . </s>
think about it . this attack is gener@@ ic . </s>
he doesn &apos;t have anything to do with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , with ur@@ ani@@ zation . </s>
so for example , he would work exactly as well -- in a power station , or in a car factory . </s>
it &apos;s gener@@ ic . </s>
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attac@@ ker -- you don &apos;t have to take the data data off a us@@ b stick stick , as we saw at stu@@ x@@ net . </s>
you could also use ordinary wor@@ m technology for spreading . </s>
you only have to spread it as much as you can . </s>
and if you do that , then you get a cyber@@ destruction weapon . </s>
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to face . </s>
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for those attacks are not in the middle east . </s>
they are in the united states , in europe and in japan . </s>
so all these green areas , these are the most pl@@ enti@@ ful environments . </s>
we need to put the consequences and we start to prepare for ourselves . </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;ve got a question . </s>
r@@ al@@ ph , there &apos;s been a lot of reported that people believe that the main organization is the main organization behind it . </s>
is that your opinion as well ? </s>
okay , you really want to know that ? </s>
yeah . okay . </s>
i think the answer is involved , but the driving force is not israel . </s>
so the driving force over here is cy@@ ber super@@ power . </s>
there &apos;s only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , for happiness . </s>
because otherwise our problem would be even larger . </s>
thank you for setting us up a mar@@ vel@@ ous fear . thanks r@@ al@@ ph . </s>
i &apos;ve spent the last few years trying to place myself in situations that are usually very difficult and kind of dangerous at the same time . </s>
i went to prison -- difficult . </s>
i &apos;ve worked in a coal mining -- dangerous . </s>
i fil@@ med in war areas -- difficult and dangerous . </s>
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing like this -- walking at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end . </s>
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the most part of my career in terms of terrible situations , and it &apos;s all for trying to study social issues that they &apos;re comp@@ elling and interesting , and hopefully in a way to understand what makes it fun and accessible to the audience . </s>
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of br@@ ass and spon@@ sor@@ ing , i knew i would do something a little bit different . </s>
some of you may have heard that i &apos;ve heard a couple of weeks ago at e@@ bay on e@@ bay a couple weeks ago . </s>
i sent out some facebook messages , some twitter news stories , and i gave people the opportunity to get nam@@ eless rights on my tedtalk 2011 . </s>
really , some happy people and companies , for@@ -@@ profit and non-@@ profit , made the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson will never leave that back -- the name of nam@@ eless rights to the talk that you &apos;re seeing at the moment had not had a lot of content at that point , and not many evidence of what the topic would be . </s>
so what you got was this : your name here : my tedtalk , my tedtalk , that you have no idea what the topic will be , and that you could ever eventually fly to your ears , especially when i get your company stupid for your participa@@ tion . </s>
but apart from that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity . </s>
you know , how many people look at these tedtalks ? </s>
a whole lot . </s>
that &apos;s just the job , by the way . </s>
so despite this war@@ ning , i knew anybody would buy the name of name . </s>
if you had asked me a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this in mind . </s>
but in the new project that i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising . </s>
as i said , i &apos;ve given myself in some pretty horrible situations over the course of the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could get me to go to anything as difficult and as dangerous as these guys were in a room . </s>
you know , i had the idea for a film . </s>
what i &apos;d like to do is a film about product plac@@ ement , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by product plac@@ ement , marketing and advertising . </s>
and the film is going to be called &quot; the leaving world ever . &quot; </s>
so what happens in &quot; the meeting ever ever happened &quot; is that everything , from top to bottom , from the beginning to the beginning , is completely seen with br@@ ands -- from the front spon@@ sor you &apos;ll see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand x@@ . </s>
now this brand , the qual@@ com@@ m sta@@ di@@ on , the sta@@ ir@@ case center ... </s>
these people will be connected to the film forever -- for forever . </s>
and so the movie will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in e@@ ase , forever , for forever ? </s>
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person . </s>
it was more to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze . </s>
it was &quot; in e@@ ter@@ nity , for forever . &quot; </s>
but we &apos;re not only going to have the brand x as a cover spon@@ sor , but we &apos;re going to make sure we &apos;re going to sell any possible categ@@ ory on the movie . </s>
so we might sell a sho@@ e and he will get the greatest sho@@ e you &apos;ve ever wor@@ n ... </s>
the greatest car you &apos;ve ever dan@@ ced from &quot; the guide ever ever , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a awareness of &quot; the execu@@ tion ever gone . &quot; </s>
so the idea is , besi@@ des saying that br@@ ands are a part of life , actually , to get them to finance the film ? </s>
and we actually show the whole process of how it works . </s>
the goal of the whole film is transparency . </s>
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of stat@@ s . </s>
so this is the whole concept , all the film , from the beginning to end . </s>
and i &apos;d be happy if ce@@ g would help to do that . </s>
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience . </s>
i don &apos;t know how reci@@ pro@@ cal people are going to be . </s>
have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because that has a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but do you know how this is going to evolve ? </s>
how much money is needed to realize that ? </s>
1.@@ 5 million . </s>
i think it will be difficult to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth worth some really , really , some really known br@@ ands . </s>
who knows when the movie comes out , we might look like a hor@@ ror of vol@@ um@@ es . </s>
what do you think the answer will be ? </s>
the answer is extremely likely to be &quot; no . &quot; </s>
but is it a difficult thing to do because of the film , or a difficult thing for me ? </s>
j@@ k : both . </s>
... so , not so optimistic . </s>
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help . </s>
i can help . </s>
okay . </s>
fantastic . </s>
we have to think about what br@@ ands . </s>
yeah . </s>
if you look at the people that they have to do with it . </s>
there are some places that we can turn to . </s>
think of the camera . </s>
i thought , &quot; well imagine the camera , would mean we wanted to have a back@@ yard conversation . </s>
it turned out that it meant actually , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with your movie . &quot; </s>
and just so all these companies disappeared , one after the other . </s>
no one wants to do something to the movie . </s>
i was ama@@ zed . </s>
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project . </s>
and i was conf@@ used , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was to present your product as many people as possible , as many people as possible . </s>
especially in the world today , at this inter@@ section of new and old media and the frag@@ mented media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting tool tool , that the mas@@ ses can bring this message . </s>
no , that was what i thought . </s>
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a fat@@ al mistake , and that was the following . </s>
actually , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all . </s>
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all . </s>
that would have been good . </s>
but that &apos;s what this picture is , it &apos;s a problem . </s>
you see , when you put transparency on the google search search -- this is one of the first pictures that seems to me . </s>
i really like your way , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . now . </s>
this was the problem : transparency -- free of de@@ ception and so@@ ap , just to explore and look through ; immediately , characteri@@ zed by visi@@ bility and access to information , especially what business practices are -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem . </s>
you know , we hear a whole lot about transparency right now . </s>
our politicians say it , our president , even our ce@@ os , say it . </s>
but when it comes to the point that it &apos;s supposed to be imple@@ mented , something changes . </s>
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like this strange bear bear , which is still still bre@@ eding . </s>
it &apos;s un@@ predictable -- like this strange road street . </s>
and she &apos;s also very ris@@ ky . </s>
what else is ris@@ ky ? </s>
it &apos;s a whole cool whi@@ p of grass . </s>
this is very ris@@ ky . </s>
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story . </s>
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot; </s>
you see , when i was a kid , and my father caught me in lying -- and he si@@ ts , and he looks at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there is three ver@@ sions of three ver@@ sions of every story . </s>
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot; </s>
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version . </s>
but there was only one company , an agency willing to help us -- and that was just because i knew john bond and richard kir@@ sh@@ en@@ tree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the midd@@ le-@@ man and go right with my team to go to the companies . </s>
so what they started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking with these companies , the idea of how your brand will be understood is a bro@@ ad problem . </s>
i have friends who are making big giant hollywood hollywood movies , and i have friends that make little wor@@ m movies like me . </s>
and my friends , the big , giant hollywood movies , say that the reason why their films are so successful at the brand partners that they have . </s>
and then my friends who are making little wor@@ rying movies , &quot; well , how are we going to compe@@ te with these big , gigan@@ tic hollywood film ? &quot; </s>
and the film is called &quot; the drives &apos;s ever gone . &quot; </s>
so how are we going to see ban in this movie ? </s>
every time i go on the way , and whenever i open the medical cab@@ in@@ et , they will see you see de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant . </s>
and every time i interview someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ? </s>
are they right there ? they look a little bit nervous . </s>
i want to help them , cal@@ m down . </s>
so maybe you should put up a little bit of this interview before the interview . &quot; </s>
and then we offer one of these great dun@@ es . </s>
either fl@@ ash fusion or a &quot; par@@ ad@@ ise win@@ ds , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice . </s>
we &apos;re being equi@@ pped for men and for women -- solid , ro@@ le-@@ on , or a stick , whatever . </s>
this is the short term . </s>
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you a good detail . </s>
we &apos;re a smaller brand . </s>
as you &apos;ve been talking about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand challen@@ ged . </s>
so we don &apos;t have a budget like any other br@@ ands . </s>
so doing things like this -- you know , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ated people -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested . </s>
what words would you describe to them ? </s>
ban is blan@@ k . </s>
that &apos;s a great question . </s>
trans@@ fer@@ red technology was ob@@ so@@ le@@ te . </s>
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone &apos;s doing under the ach@@ es . </s>
we &apos;re talking about co@@ ws , fresh . </s>
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this categ@@ ory really makes too much positive , as opposed to &quot; fighting smell and hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty . &quot; </s>
it st@@ ops you . </s>
how can we keep them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times fresh . </s>
these things have a more positive effect . </s>
and this is a milli@@ on-@@ dollar company . </s>
what about myself ? what about the inter@@ section of action ? </s>
i have to talk to the man in the street , who are like me , ot@@ to normal consumers . </s>
you should tell me something about my brand . </s>
how would you describe your brand ? </s>
h@@ mm@@ m , my brand ? </s>
i don &apos;t know . </s>
i really like beautiful clothes . </s>
198@@ 0s : re@@ vi@@ val hit on sc@@ ater@@ al pun@@ k , except for the wash@@ ing day . </s>
all right , what &apos;s the brand ger@@ ry ? </s>
unique . </s>
i think the gen@@ us , the style that i have , is &quot; dark glamour . &quot; </s>
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gray colors and stuff like that . </s>
but i normally have an ac@@ cess@@ ories , like sun@@ glasses , or a je@@ wel@@ ry and a stuff like that . </s>
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic mer@@ ce@@ des cab@@ rio . </s>
man 2 : the brand that i &apos;m being , i would say , is very serious fly . </s>
part 2 : part yo@@ g@@ ie , part yo@@ g@@ i girl , i don &apos;t know -- i don &apos;t know . </s>
man three : i &apos;m the sh@@ ard of the art . </s>
i sell sc@@ is@@ sor@@ s all over the country around the country . </s>
so i think that this is my brand . </s>
this is my brand in my little , di@@ stor@@ ted industry . </s>
man 4 : my brand is fe@@ de@@ x because i &apos;ve been more wal@@ ned . </s>
man 5 : brand trained al@@ co@@ hol addi@@ ction . </s>
is this happening ? </s>
lawyer : i &apos;m a cele@@ bri@@ ty . </s>
i &apos;m tom . </s>
well , we can &apos;t all be the tom@@ my brand , but i often see myself at the interface of dark glamour and brown fly . </s>
and what realized was that i needed an expert . </s>
i needed somebody who could go into my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call the &quot; brand personality . &quot; </s>
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ alt@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ burg . </s>
they have helped companies like ne@@ st@@ le , fe@@ a@@ thers , hall@@ mark helped to discover this brand personality . </s>
if they could do it , they could also help me . </s>
you brought your pictures , right ? </s>
this is what i have . the first picture is a picture of my family . </s>
tell me a little bit about how that &apos;s connected to your thoughts and feelings about it . </s>
these are the people who form my world@@ view . </s>
tell me about the world . </s>
m@@ d : this world ? i think the world is the world in which you live -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so on . </s>
all of these things come and start from one place , and for me , they come and start with my family in west virginia . </s>
so what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about . </s>
next . this is the most beautiful day of my life . </s>
what context is this about the mind and feelings about themselves ? </s>
it &apos;s the way i want to be . </s>
i like things that are different . </s>
i like things that are weird . i like weird things . </s>
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what do you bring us ? </s>
what &apos;s the ma@@ che@@ te ? what kind of pu@@ ppe@@ te@@ er are you now ? </s>
why is it important to start no@@ vel@@ ing ? what is the red represents ? </s>
tell me a little bit about that part . </s>
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you . </s>
what other me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ ses have gone through ? </s>
it doesn &apos;t have to be frighten@@ ing . what kind of roll@@ er@@ co@@ aster are they ? </s>
ee@@ ee@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you . </s>
thank you very much for your pati@@ ence . </s>
yeah . all right . </s>
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get out of it . </s>
there was a lot of crazy things going on there . </s>
the first thing that i saw was this idea that their brand personality personality was two separate , but it has supp@@ lied pages -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lo@@ ke brand brand is an ei@@ ght-@@ played brand brand . </s>
they &apos;re very good at clean@@ ing up . </s>
and i think there &apos;s almost a con@@ tradi@@ ction there . </s>
and i think some companies will only focus on one strength rather than both of them . </s>
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- things that they &apos;re not sure of , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and that they welcome these elements , and they turn them into something positive for themselves , and that &apos;s a mar@@ vel@@ ous box . </s>
what other br@@ ands are like that ? </s>
the first one is a classic apple , apple . </s>
and you can see it here , target , wi@@ i , min@@ i co@@ op@@ er and je@@ t@@ blue . </s>
well , there are br@@ us@@ hing br@@ ands and eigh@@ ty br@@ ands , these things that come and go , but a play@@ ful brand , eight brand is a pretty strong thing . </s>
an ei@@ ght-@@ leg@@ ged brand brand brand . how is your brand ? </s>
if anybody would ask you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , how would you be ? </s>
you &apos;re a up@@ -@@ breathing ? are you something that brings blood into whales in whales ? </s>
or are they more like a down at@@ titude ? </s>
are they something that is a little bit more quiet , more conserva@@ tive , more conserva@@ tive ? </s>
up@@ -@@ attribu@@ tes are things that are play@@ ful , fresh like the usual prin@@ ce , ti@@ ming , ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous and lo@@ cated like er@@ ol fl@@ yn@@ n and agi@@ le and agi@@ le , glori@@ ous , ma@@ gical and my@@ sti@@ cal and my@@ sti@@ f . </s>
or are they more like a down at@@ titude ? </s>
are you mind@@ ful and mon@@ gu@@ n like 00@@ 7 ? </s>
are they establi@@ shed , traditional , nur@@ turing , prote@@ ctive , com@@ passionate like op@@ ra@@ h ? </s>
are they reli@@ able , stable , family , safe , hol@@ y , hol@@ y , al@@ together , like the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ? </s>
in the course of that film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down companies , and the &quot; no &quot; said , &quot; no , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project . &quot; </s>
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with this film , because they didn &apos;t have any control over the finished product . </s>
but , 17 mar@@ ti@@ an partners , who were willing to negoti@@ ate on these control , who wanted to do business with somebody as eigh@@ th and play@@ ful like me , and eventually em@@ powered us to tell stories that we otherwise could not have told -- stories that would never support a value . </s>
they em@@ powered us to tell the story of neuro@@ marketing , as we tell the story in this film , that you use mri today to make the pleasure centers of the brain , both on advertising and movies . </s>
we went to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o , where foreign commer@@ ci@@ als had been ban@@ ned . </s>
the whole city has not been found in the entire city for five years , no poster , no fl@@ yer , nothing . </s>
and we went to school distri@@ cts where companies are pa@@ sting their way into im@@ por@@ ted schools , all over america . </s>
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i get most feedback from , or where i &apos;ve had the greatest success , those are where i directly inter@@ ac@@ ted with things . </s>
and that &apos;s what those br@@ ands have done . </s>
because they went around the medi@@ an , they went around the agen@@ cies , and they said that maybe the auth@@ orities may not really have their interest in mind . </s>
i &apos;m going to negoti@@ ate with the artist directly . </s>
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people get to think that our world is challenging . </s>
and how was that for you ? how successful ? </s>
now , since the movie was pre@@ mi@@ er at the s@@ und@@ ance film festival , we can look at it . </s>
bur@@ r@@ al was the pre@@ mi@@ ere in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 9@@ 00 million calls from this film . </s>
it &apos;s actually just a two-@@ year period of two and two weeks . </s>
this is just online -- no press , no television . </s>
the film hasn &apos;t been deli@@ vered yet . </s>
it doesn &apos;t even exist online . no stre@@ tch . </s>
it hasn &apos;t come out of other countries . </s>
well , finally , the film has taken a very big moment@@ um . </s>
and this is not bad for a project where almost every commercial agency that we talked about recom@@ men@@ ding their customers of their customers . </s>
one of the things that i believe is that when you get your chance , you take risks , you take risks in those risks that exist in those risks . </s>
i think if you hold people out of it , you get them closer to failure . </s>
i believe that if you train your employees to avoid risk , you prepared the whole company to get a profit . </s>
i feel that we need to go forward and encourage people to take risks . </s>
we have to encourage people not to have fear of opportunities that maybe you might be worried about . </s>
finally , in adv@@ ance , we should welcome fear . </s>
we should put the bear in the c@@ age . </s>
are you afraid of fear . are you welcome to risk . </s>
each is a large lion , so we &apos;re welcome to the risk of the risk . </s>
and finally , should we welcome transparency . </s>
today , more than ever before , a little bit of honest@@ y will get us very far . </s>
and that said , with honest@@ y and transparency , my whole talk , &quot; are welcome transparency &quot; from my good friends of em@@ c , who was paying $ 7@@ 100 for the name of e@@ bay on e@@ bay . </s>
big data is transformed all over the world for organizations around the world . </s>
em@@ c pres@@ ents , &quot; are you welcome transparency ? &quot; </s>
thank you very much . </s>
now , mor@@ gan , in the name of transparency , this is what happens to the $ 7@@ 100 ? </s>
that &apos;s a great question . </s>
i have a check in my pocket , a check to the top organization of the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ ing foundation -- a check of $ 7@@ 100 to fund my ted performance in the next year . </s>
my name is am@@ it . </s>
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i realized to do something about muse@@ ums and art -- my che@@ f@@ in , which is also green today , gave me green light . </s>
and it took 18 months . </s>
a lot of fun negoti@@ ations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting muse@@ ums from nine countries . </s>
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o . </s>
there are a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this . </s>
i think my personal vision is very simple with this slide and access to it . </s>
i grew up in india . </s>
i became a great education -- i won &apos;t do it -- but i had too many muse@@ ums and i had no access to this art@@ work . </s>
when i was traveling , and visit these muse@@ ums , i started learning a lot . </s>
and while i was working for google , i tried to make this lon@@ ging -- to make art more accessible -- to bring technology together . </s>
we then created a team , a great team , and we started with this . </s>
i think i &apos;ll start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that have happened since the launch . </s>
so , you go to google proje@@ ct@@ t-@@ proje@@ ct@@ .@@ com@@ . </s>
you can look around all these muse@@ ums here in all these muse@@ ums . </s>
there is the u@@ ff@@ i@@ zi , mom@@ a , the her@@ mit@@ age , the ri@@ j@@ ks , the van go@@ gh . </s>
i even come to one of my favorite , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york . </s>
you get to two because of it -- very simple . </s>
now , and w@@ um@@ ms , you &apos;re in this museum . </s>
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference . </s>
you go around and you am@@ pli@@ fy yourself . </s>
you want to ori@@ ent in the museum ? </s>
open the map , and jump on a click on a click . </s>
in there they are ; they want to go to the end of the gan@@ gs . </s>
just on . lots of fun . </s>
bu@@ ri@@ sh@@ er them . </s>
thank you , but the best part . </s>
so here i am before one of my favorite images , ern@@ ers of pie@@ ter bre@@ u@@ gel in his met . </s>
i see this pl@@ under@@ er . </s>
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it . </s>
so this is one of the images . </s>
this is all the meta@@ data . </s>
those of you who are really interested in art can click on you -- but i &apos;ll click it out now . </s>
this is one of the images that we captured with the so-called gi@@ gap@@ i@@ x@@ ic technology technology . </s>
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion points of view , i believe . </s>
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points ? &quot; </s>
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you now . </s>
you can very easily go in and zoom out . </s>
you can see something fun here . </s>
i love this guy ; his expression is pri@@ c@@ eless . </s>
but then you really want deep in . </s>
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there was something happening there . </s>
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot; </s>
i went close , and i slowly noticed that these kids actually beat something . </s>
i research a little bit , speaking to some people at the met , and actually found out that it &apos;s a game called squ@@ a@@ il , which is a stick on the fast tu@@ es@@ day with a stick . </s>
apparently it was quite popular . </s>
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it . </s>
in fact , to go close , you can go to the cra@@ cks . </s>
just to give you a sense of view , i zoom in , so you see what you get . </s>
here we are , and this is the painting . </s>
but the best part is , in a second . </s>
so let &apos;s jump to mom@@ a , jump back in new york . </s>
another favorite picture of me , star night . </s>
in the previous example , it was about finding detail . </s>
but what if you want to see the brush stri@@ ke ? </s>
and what if you wanted to see van go@@ gh created the master@@ piece of this master@@ piece ? </s>
you zo@@ om@@ ed in . you can actually go in there . </s>
i &apos;m going to zoom in on one of my favorite parts of this picture , until i &apos;m really in the ris@@ es . </s>
this is star night , probably never seen this before . </s>
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function . </s>
there are many others , but i don &apos;t have time . </s>
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called colle@@ ctions . </s>
every one of you , everyone -- the same as rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter . </s>
you can go out and create your own museum online -- from all these images , you can put your own collection of your own collection . </s>
very simple , you go in -- and i created this , which is the power of drive -- you can zoom in . </s>
this is the pra@@ yer , in the nation@@ alism . </s>
you can look at everything , sending your friends , send your friends about what you feel when you &apos;re looking at these master@@ pieces . </s>
i think , finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google . </s>
they don &apos;t come out of me in terms of muse@@ ums . </s>
i might not say that . </s>
they come from the artists . </s>
and that was an experience in humili@@ ty for me . </s>
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to talk about this digital medium of art , and represent them properly online . </s>
and the biggest question i asked myself recently was , &quot; did you do this , to repli@@ cate the experience of a museum visit ? &quot; </s>
the answer to that is no . </s>
it &apos;s to fill the experience . </s>
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you . </s>
thank you . </s>
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two cam@@ ps . </s>
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , that &apos;s the intuitive side . </s>
if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ ti@@ t@@ ters of every hemis@@ ph@@ ere , we could call her brain . </s>
for instance , that would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical . </s>
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive . </s>
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ? </s>
some of us may have decided to have one of those extreme , but i think that , for most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a high ap@@ ti@@ t@@ ment that &apos;s at the same time in both hemis@@ ph@@ ere . </s>
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclu@@ sive or the same . </s>
they can be logical and intuitive . </s>
and this is how i look at myself as one of these people , along with most other experiment@@ al quantum physi@@ ci@@ sts , who need a good share of logic in order to bring together the complex ideas . </s>
but at the same time , we need a good share of intuition to actually lead the experiments . </s>
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play things with things . </s>
so we go out and we play it and see how it respon@@ ds , and then we start to develop our intuition . </s>
they &apos;re basically doing the same thing . </s>
so one of the intui@@ tions they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can be in the same time at the same time . </s>
i mean , it can sound weird to think that this is a thing at the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed it . </s>
i remember seeing a kid playing on play on a ground thres@@ hold . </s>
he was a little kid , and not very good at it , and he fell all the time . </s>
but i bet it teach@@ es him a very valuable lesson , a very valuable lesson , that the big stuff doesn &apos;t just leave you through , and that they stay in one place . </s>
and that &apos;s a great concep@@ tual model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not particle physi@@ ci@@ sts . </s>
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with ground pig@@ s , but with these little weird particles . </s>
and when they play with their particles , they make all sorts of weird things -- how they fly directly through walls , or that they can be at the same time in two different places . </s>
and so they wrote all these obser@@ vations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechan@@ ics . </s>
that was the state of physics a few years ago ; they needed quantum mechan@@ ics to describe the small , tiny particles . </s>
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us . </s>
it didn &apos;t sound my intuition , and maybe that might just because i don &apos;t often play with particles so often . </s>
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often . </s>
and i &apos;ve never seen it . </s>
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle particle . </s>
but my logical side didn &apos;t do it either . </s>
because when all the things are made up of particles , and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechan@@ ics , shouldn &apos;t it just follow the rules of quantum mechan@@ ics ? </s>
i don &apos;t see a reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way . </s>
so i &apos;d feel really better about this whole thing , if we could somehow show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quantum mechan@@ ics . </s>
so i set out to do this a few years ago to do this . </s>
i created one . </s>
this is the first object you can see in the quantum mechanical super@@ position . </s>
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip . </s>
and you can see that green dot there in the middle . </s>
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about right now . </s>
this is a picture of the object . </s>
here i am doing something . we &apos;re looking at the center here . </s>
and here &apos;s a really big clo@@ se@@ -up of this little piece of metal . </s>
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s shaped like a spr@@ ing@@ board , and it &apos;s standing over the edge . </s>
so i took this thing in similar ways that you make a computer chip . </s>
i went to a clean room with new silicon dis@@ ks , and i re@@ covered for 100 hours of all the big stuff . </s>
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this kind of a swimming pool and got the thing to get the thing . </s>
now , this thing has the ability to be in the quantum mechanical super@@ position , but it takes a little bit of help to do it . </s>
look , let me give you an analog@@ y . </s>
you know , how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a full elev@@ ator ? </s>
i mean , when i &apos;m alone in the elev@@ ator , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people go up and i listen to all these things , and i &apos;m listening to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to har@@ ness them , or , frankly , they blu@@ r . </s>
so quantum mechan@@ ics says that in@@ ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ble objects feel the same . </s>
the dri@@ vers of un@@ moving objects are not just people , but the light that seems to sh@@ ine on them and the wind that goes over to you and the heat of the space . </s>
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal beha@@ ves quantum mechan@@ ically , we had to throw out the whole comm@@ and out of the game . </s>
and so that &apos;s what we did . </s>
we swit@@ ched off the lights , they put it into a vac@@ uum , and we su@@ cked all the air out and cool@@ ed it up until now , all the way up in the elev@@ ator , the piece of metal was free to behave as it was going on . </s>
so we measured his movement . </s>
we found that it really was moving really strange . </s>
instead , it &apos;s just quiet there , vi@@ br@@ ating it , and the way it was vi@@ br@@ ating was something like this -- like this -- like a pro@@ li@@ fic and en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed bar . </s>
in that we gave him a little push , we could vi@@ vi@@ ate it at the same time and not vibra@@ te it at the same time -- something that &apos;s just in quantum mechan@@ ics . </s>
so what i &apos;m telling you is something that is truly fantastic . </s>
what does it mean to vibra@@ te for an object at the same time and not vibra@@ te ? </s>
let &apos;s think about the atoms . </s>
so the first case : all the trilli@@ ons of atoms out of that piece of metal are still there , and at the same time the atoms are moving up and down at the same time . </s>
just in precise time points do you agree . </s>
at the end of time , they &apos;re del@@ oc@@ ated . </s>
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which is at the same time that the entire piece of metal is in two different places . </s>
i think that &apos;s really cool . </s>
really . </s>
this was worth compared to all this year in the clean space space , because , check that , the mas@@ king difference between an individual atom and this piece of metal is about as much as the difference between the piece of metal and you . </s>
so if a single atom can be at the same time in two different places , that piece of metal can be in two different places , why not you ? </s>
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side is . </s>
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time in multiple places , what would that feel like ? </s>
how would you deal with your consciousness that your body &apos;s bodies are del@@ oc@@ ated ? </s>
there &apos;s another aspect about the story . </s>
when we war@@ med it up , the lights up and the box went , we saw that the piece of metal was always there in a piece of metal . </s>
and so i had to develop this new intuition , that it looks like all the objects in the elev@@ ator are really only available objects that are made together in a small space . </s>
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechan@@ ics is saying that everything is connected to everything . </s>
well , that &apos;s not quite right . </s>
there &apos;s more behind it , it &apos;s even deeper . </s>
it is that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that is the profound and strange of quantum mechan@@ ics . </s>
thank you . </s>
in 2007 , i decided that we should re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we think about economic development . </s>
it should be our goal that when families think about where they live and work , they want to give them an opportunity to choose between at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competition for new resi@@ dents . </s>
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal . </s>
there are billions of people in the developing world who don &apos;t even have a single city that would welcome them . </s>
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than it costs them to build . </s>
so we could explo@@ it the world very simply , perhaps , with hundreds of new cities of new cities . </s>
now this may sound absur@@ d for you , but you &apos;ve never thought about new cities before . </s>
but they just trade the construction of the a@@ part@@ ments in the cities . </s>
imagine half the people who want to live in res@@ identi@@ al a@@ part@@ ments ; the other half are not yet yet . </s>
you could try to ex@@ tend the capacity of the existing a@@ part@@ ments . </s>
but , you know , what they would do is , you know , in these res@@ identi@@ al laws , and their surro@@ und@@ ings of their environment to avoid avo@@ i@@ ding and ex@@ posing them . </s>
so it turns out it &apos;s a very difficult thing to get out of all of these exten@@ sions . </s>
but you could go to a whole new place , build a whole new housing block , imagine that the law would support the laws of building such a building and not prevent it . </s>
so i &apos;ve suggest@@ ed that governments create new surfaces that provide enough space for a city and give them a name : char@@ ter cities . </s>
later , i found that , about the same time , ja@@ 4 and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o have been thinking about the challenge of reform in hon@@ dur@@ as . </s>
they knew that every year , about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ ors left her country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do , to make sure that these people could stay in their country and do exactly the same in hon@@ dur@@ as . </s>
at this point , ja@@ 4 has said to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; what happens if we take an im@@ it@@ ated area of our country -- what if we just give them a message -- a part of the american message ; a part of the can@@ adi@@ an bot@@ t@@ len@@ e@@ ck , and if people want to work under the can@@ adi@@ an rules or the united states , they can work there , and can they do anything on the surface of these messages , which they usually have to go to canada or america ? &quot; </s>
in the summer 2009 , li@@ tt hon@@ dur@@ as li@@ t under a fi@@ er@@ c@@ ely crisis crisis . </s>
in the next plan@@ ting election , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won an en@@ vel@@ ope whose program promis@@ es both no@@ vel@@ ty and sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ders . </s>
he asked oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to become his ste@@ am . </s>
in the mean@@ time , i was prepar@@ ing a talk at tedglobal . </s>
through improvement , trying and through the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of char@@ ter city to the key elements . </s>
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you cannot distur@@ b existing housing ow@@ ners . </s>
we give great attention to new technology , but for progress to progress and law , and it &apos;s usually laws that keep us back . </s>
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of gu@@ atem@@ ala oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o sent the link to the tedtalk . </s>
and it showed him ja@@ 4 . </s>
they called me out of the two . </s>
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the head of our country . &quot; </s>
so we met in dec@@ ember at the sitting room of a hotel in mi@@ ami . </s>
i &apos;ve tried to make clear of how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost . </s>
and i used this graph to show how valuable ro@@ hl@@ and is in a place like new york . remember that a area in some cases is worth thousands of dollars . </s>
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at one point when there was a pause , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , could we look at the tedtalk . &quot; </s>
so the tedtalk turned out to be very simple , that a char@@ ter city is a place where the un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited country is , a fo@@ unding contract contract , which is the laws of the law that the law pi@@ cks up there and people the opportunity to choose to decide either to live under those rules or not . </s>
and that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as who said that we need to make this project important , and that this is the way to bring our country forward . </s>
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa and give a talk to the fourth and fifth january of january . </s>
so , i &apos;ve given another talk to facts that have a graphics like this , which tries to illu@@ strate that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very big city . </s>
this is a picture of the city den@@ ver , and the sket@@ ch represents the new airport that was built in den@@ ver . </s>
this airport alone has a hundred square kilometers . </s>
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the hon@@ dur@@ ans that if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 square kilometers . </s>
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow . </s>
poli@@ tely , they all appl@@ au@@ d . </s>
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention . </s>
the director of the congress came on the stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk . </s>
i have it on my laptop here . &quot; </s>
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk . </s>
and i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that a new city has new opportunities for people to do new opportunities . </s>
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in hon@@ dur@@ as instead of hundreds of miles away in the north . </s>
and a new city includes new opportunities for leaders as well . </s>
the leaders of the government in hon@@ dur@@ as would have been pro@@ posed to the help of partner@@ ship countries , and they could benefit from their community countries that would help them build the laws of this char@@ ter char@@ ter and the execu@@ tion , that anybody can trust the char@@ ter that the char@@ ter will actually go through . </s>
and the insight from president lo@@ bo was that the trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation that i &apos;ve been thinking about as a way to get foreign inve@@ stors and build this city and build this city for all parties in hon@@ dur@@ as that could be under fear of fear and mi@@ str@@ ust for many years . </s>
we &apos;ve gone to an area . </s>
this picture is taken from this place . </s>
it &apos;s com@@ pris@@ ed of thousands of square miles . </s>
and shor@@ tly after , in the 19th of january , they voted for congress to change the constit@@ ution in order to have a prescri@@ ption policy that is available for particular development areas . </s>
in a country that has just been a massive crisis in congress , congress was elected for this adap@@ tive change in 1@@ 24 to a voice . </s>
all the parties , all the lessons from society , were suppor@@ ting this . </s>
in order to be part of the constit@@ ution , it has to be appro@@ ved twice by congress . </s>
on febru@@ ary , the second time , it was appro@@ ved at 1@@ 14 to a voice . </s>
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24@@ th , febru@@ ary , a dele@@ gation of about 30 dog hun@@ ches traveled to the two places in the world that were most interested in getting into the business of the city . </s>
one place is south korea . </s>
this is a picture of a big new city city , built in south korea in south korea -- big than the center of the city . </s>
everything that you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took it four years to get the appro@@ val of the per@@ mission . </s>
the other place that was very interested in urban development is sing@@ apo@@ re . </s>
it &apos;s already been built in china , and the third is in prepar@@ ation . </s>
so if you think about it virtually , it &apos;s where we are today . </s>
you already have a building block , and you &apos;re already men@@ tioning this area for the second city . </s>
it &apos;s already worked on a legal system that allows mana@@ gers to participate , and it &apos;s also worked on an ex@@ ternal legal system . </s>
a country has already offered its su@@ pre@@ me court as a court as a court for the local cour@@ ts of the local court . </s>
also , urban designers and farmer are very interested . </s>
they even bring funding to them . </s>
one thing , as you know , has been en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed , there &apos;s a lot of r@@ ent . </s>
there are a lot of businesses that would be happy in america , especially at a place with a free trade zone , and there are lots of people who would like to live there . </s>
all over the world , there are 700 million people who say they want to live permanent in a different place . </s>
a million people are leaving a latin america every year , and migra@@ te to the united states every year . </s>
many of them are fathers who are forced to leave their families back to su@@ ck their families -- sometimes single mothers who need to make enough money to eat food and clo@@ thing . </s>
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even children who try to find their parents that they , in some cases , have no longer seen for a decade . </s>
so what is it for an idea to think about building a completely new city in hon@@ dur@@ as ? </s>
or even building these cities out of these cities , or hundreds of hundreds around the world ? </s>
so what is it for an idea to ins@@ ist every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in competition for new resi@@ dents ? </s>
this is an idea that is worth spreading . </s>
my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say , thank ted . </s>
do you know how much decisions you make in a typical day ? </s>
do you know how much decisions you make in a typical week ? </s>
i recently made a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that make a typical american in a day make a typical day is 7@@ 0@@ .@@ 7 . </s>
and also , recently , a study was done with ce@@ o , where they saw the ce@@ os for a week . </s>
and these scientists have simply docum@@ ented the various top@@ ics that this ce@@ o has done , and how much time they spend decisions related to the top@@ ics . </s>
and they &apos;ve found that an average ce@@ o is dealing with 13@@ 9 jobs in the week of 13@@ 9 . </s>
each of these the@@ mes has come from many , many , many smaller decisions . </s>
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less . </s>
only for about 12 percent of their decisions took them an hour , or more of their time . </s>
think about your own decisions . </s>
do you know how many decisions you make in the nine minutes of categ@@ ory against those of you in an hour of categ@@ ory ? </s>
how well do you think they are in making the decisions ? </s>
today i want to talk about one of the greatest decisi@@ on-@@ making problems in our modern times , the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem . </s>
i want to talk about the problem , and i want to talk about some possible solutions . </s>
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers . </s>
when i ask you a question , raise your hand where i &apos;m blind , just your hand , if you want to burn some cal@@ ories . </s>
otherwise , please ask me , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , well , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear anything about the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem ? </s>
thank you . </s>
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very very exclu@@ sive tra@@ iler , and at least he was really exclu@@ sive . </s>
it was a store that was called dra@@ g@@ ger &apos;s . </s>
this business , it was almost like a pleas@@ ant savings . </s>
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ d and hor@@ ror and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vege@@ tables and more than two dozen different types of water -- and this was at a time when we actually dr@@ ank water . </s>
i was loved to go to that business , but at one point i was asked , well , how come you never buying anything ? </s>
here &apos;s o@@ live oil out . </s>
they had over 75 different o@@ live oil , including those who were embedded in boxes that were coming out of thousands of years of old o@@ live trees . </s>
so one day i decided to go to the fi@@ li@@ min@@ er , and i asked the director , &quot; does this model work for people to offer all those choices ? &quot; </s>
and he showed up on the bus char@@ ges of tou@@ ri@@ sts who came every day and usually had their cameras . </s>
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose brand brand for our experiment . </s>
this is their brand tra@@ il . </s>
they had 3@@ 48 different kinds of dec@@ lin@@ ade . </s>
we &apos;ve put a little bit of prescri@@ ption straight into the ent@@ r@@ ance of business . </s>
we &apos;ve put six different ta@@ stes of fla@@ vor@@ s there or 24 different fla@@ vor@@ s or 24 different fla@@ vor@@ s , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : one , which way would i have more people to stand up and try and try and try and try ? </s>
there are more people standing when they were 24 , about 60 percent than if they were six , about 40 percent . </s>
and then we looked at what people were more likely to buy a glass of ba@@ th@@ room . </s>
now we saw the reverse effect . </s>
by the people who stayed when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of glass . </s>
the people who stayed when they were six , well , now we saw 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mars . </s>
well , if you calcul@@ ated it , people bought six times more likely to have a glass sig@@ ning , who they had six times as if they were 24 . </s>
now , deci@@ ding to buy no glass glass is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wa@@ ist -- but it turns out that the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem influ@@ ences us with very consi@@ stent decisions . </s>
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even when it comes to our own best interests . </s>
so the theme of the day is to save financial savings . </s>
i &apos;m going to describe to you now a study that i did with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , kam@@ en@@ ica , we@@ i j@@ ang , where we looked at the decisions for almost a million americans from about 6@@ 50 plans in the entire united states . </s>
and what we looked at was whether the number of auth@@ orities that were allowed to do a reti@@ rement savings plan , the 40@@ 1 plan that influ@@ enced the like@@ li@@ hood of saving more tomorrow . </s>
and what we found was that there was a relationship there . </s>
so in those plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 cases that people ban@@ ned anything between two to 5@@ 9 different fun@@ ds . </s>
and what we found was that the more fund offered been that , in fact , the participa@@ tion was lower . </s>
so if you look at the extre@@ mes , the plans for the two fun@@ ds , the plans that have happened in the 197@@ 0s in the 197@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want it . </s>
in the case that nearly ban@@ ned nearly 60 years , they dropped to about the six@@ th percent now . </s>
now , it turns out , even when they participate in each other , when they have more opportunities for choices , even then it has negative consequences . </s>
so the people who decided to participate , more or more , the more possibilities they have provided them , the more they r@@ ent it and choose it to choose it . </s>
the more possibilities you have available , the more they put their whole money into pure financial market accoun@@ ts . </s>
none of these extreme decisions , belon@@ ging to the decisions that someone of people would recom@@ mend if their future financial well-being is important to us . </s>
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three basic negative consequences that offer the offer of more and more choices . </s>
she &apos;s pushing the decision -- put it on , even when it &apos;s going on against its own best interest . </s>
they make worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions . </s>
they choose more to things that they make less content for themselves , even if they make it obje@@ ctive . </s>
the main reason for this is that we may enjoy these huge shel@@ ters of may@@ on@@ a@@ ise , mu@@ star@@ d , mu@@ star@@ d and mar@@ mel@@ ade , but we can &apos;t actually draw the compar@@ ison and the limit@@ ations , and then we can actually choose something from the fantastic supply . </s>
so what i &apos;d like to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different research sites -- that they can just apply to their business . </s>
first , limit@@ ing . </s>
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true as today , that less than today . </s>
people are always worried when i say , &quot; constra@@ ints . &quot; </s>
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing seas@@ ons . </s>
but in fact , we &apos;re seeing it more and more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to restri@@ ct yourself , and the un@@ important opportunities will be done , well , then there &apos;s an increase in sales , it &apos;s going to save the cost , and there &apos;s a improvement in decisi@@ on-@@ making perception . </s>
when pro@@ ctor and gam@@ ble and gam@@ ble gam@@ ble gam@@ ble species reduced 26 to 15 to 15 percent , they experienced a rise of sales by about 10 percent . </s>
when the golden cat corpo@@ ration went away from her 10 to the worst sold stre@@ ams , they experienced that the reven@@ ue of 8@@ 7 percent went up -- a result of both , the rise of sales and re@@ ducing cost . </s>
you know , the average super@@ ma@@ c cr@@ ank today , you have 4@@ 5,000 products . </s>
a typical wal@@ -@@ mart offers you 100,000 products today . </s>
but the nin@@ et@@ y-@@ largest super@@ market , the world &apos;s nin@@ et@@ y-@@ largest super@@ market in the world is al@@ di , and they provide only 1,@@ 400 products -- a kind of toma@@ to sauce in do@@ ses . </s>
now in the world of savings , i believe one of the great examples that recently came to the market , about how to do the best of choice , was something that david la@@ ja son was very much involved in , and it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard . </s> &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
every single harvard employees , automatically , takes a lifetime of life at a time . </s>
those who really want to make a selection will be offered 20 fun@@ ds , not 300 or more fun@@ ds . </s>
you know , people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to restri@@ ct them . </s>
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot; </s>
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other . </s>
and if your employees can &apos;t hold them apart , they cannot do their customers . &quot; </s>
now , before we started this morning , i had a conversation with g@@ ary . </s>
and g@@ ary said that he would be willing to offer all of the people in this audience in this audience to offer an affordable vac@@ ation to the most beautiful road in the world . </s>
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the road . </s>
and i want to read to you this one . </s>
and now i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i want to cla@@ p you if you &apos;re willing to take g@@ ary &apos;s supply . </s>
okay . everyone who is willing to take g@@ ary &apos;s supply . </s>
are all of these ? </s>
okay , let me show you a little bit more of it . </s>
you know , it was a trick , right ? </s>
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey . </s>
i think i may have heard more hands . </s>
all right . </s>
the fact is that she looked obje@@ ctively , the first time she had more information than the second time , but i would tell it to make it feel more real to the second time . </s>
because the images make it feel real for them . </s>
which brings me to the second technology , which helps them deal with the problem of decisi@@ on-@@ making , it &apos;s con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation . </s>
it &apos;s about understanding the difference between possibilities between opportunities , understanding what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that these consequences need to be vi@@ vid and specific . </s>
why do people give 15 to 30 percent more if they use an ec@@ d map or a credit card than they use in cash ? </s>
because it doesn &apos;t feel real money . </s>
and it turns out , if you make it concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool , so it &apos;s a very good tool for saving people to save more . </s>
so we made a study in a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o and al@@ ess@@ o , and we &apos;ve done a study with the people at te@@ hl@@ o -- employees , employees -- and these people were all in a meeting where they signed their participa@@ tion for their reti@@ rement savings plan . </s>
and during this gathering , we &apos;ve been getting these conven@@ tions just as they &apos;ve always been , except we &apos;ve added a little bit of li@@ f@@ ty . </s>
the small@@ est thing we added was that we asked people to just think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they would save money . </s>
when we did this simple thing , there was an increase in participa@@ tion by 20 percent , and there was an increase in the number of people willing to save , or an increase by four percent of the amount they were willing to pay for savings accoun@@ ts . </s>
third technology : categ@@ ori@@ zation . </s>
we can deal with more categ@@ ories than to deal with more choices . </s>
here &apos;s a study , for example , a study that we did in a magazine . </s>
it turns out , in the ab@@ sen@@ ce of super@@ markets up and down in the nor@@ the@@ ast area , the number between 3@@ 31 different kinds of maga@@ zin@@ es has been vari@@ ed by 6@@ 6@@ 4 maga@@ zin@@ es . </s>
but you know what ? </s>
when i show you 600 maga@@ zin@@ es and i split them in 10 categ@@ ories , or i show them 400 maga@@ zin@@ es , and i split them in 20 categ@@ ories , then you think i &apos;ve given them more choices and a better choice than i would have given you the 400 if i gave them the 600 . </s>
because the categ@@ ories tell me how to keep them apart . </s>
here are two different je@@ wel@@ ed tan@@ ks . </s>
it &apos;s called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; s@@ wing . &quot; </s>
if you think the left display is s@@ wing and the ad on your right is jazz , then you cla@@ p in your hands . </s>
okay , so there &apos;s a couple . </s>
if you think the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is s@@ wing , please cla@@ p . </s>
al@@ right , a couple more . </s>
well , it turns out they &apos;re right . </s>
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ? </s>
this is a highly un@@ useful categ@@ ory sche@@ me . </s>
the categ@@ ories have to say something that needs to say , not providing the choice . </s>
and this problem often shows you , if you look at the long bul@@ let points all of those fun@@ ds . </s>
who do you actually want to in@@ form to it ? </s>
my fourth technology : pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce of complexity . </s>
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think , we have to simpli@@ fy them . </s>
we need to increase complexity slowly . </s>
let me show you an example of what i mean . </s>
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the pur@@ chase of a car . </s>
here &apos;s a german car manufac@@ tur@@ er that gives you the opportunity to completely recon@@ ci@@ le your car . </s>
you &apos;ve got to make 6@@ 2 different decisions to make your car completely . </s>
now , these decisions are different from the number of choices that they provide per decision . </s>
car colors , ex@@ color of the car -- i have 5@@ 6 possibilities . </s>
motors , ge@@ ar -- four options . </s>
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order in which the decisions are made . </s>
half of the customers will go from the many possibilities , 5@@ 6 auto@@ colors to the low possibilities , four ge@@ ars . </s>
the other half of the customers are from the low possibilities , four ge@@ ar to the 5@@ 6 car colors , a lot of possibilities . </s>
what do i look at ? </s>
how interested you are . </s>
if you constantly use the standard choice in the decision , it means you &apos;re going to be challen@@ ged , the he@@ ating , i &apos;m losing it . </s>
what they find is that the people who go from many to the low dete@@ ction pon@@ ds go over and over and over again choose the standard choice . </s>
we are losing it . </s>
go from the little choices to a lot , then you stay with it . </s>
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities . </s>
the only thing i did is i changed the order of change in which this information is presented . </s>
when i start with the simple start , i learn how to choose . </s>
even though the ge@@ ar sele@@ ct , i don &apos;t choose to say anything about my pre@@ fer@@ ences in the inter@@ ior , it &apos;s still prepar@@ ing for me to choose it . </s>
it also makes me excited about the great product of the great product that i put together , and so i &apos;m willing to motiv@@ ate myself to be interested in being interested in this . </s>
let me wra@@ p it up . </s>
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that the problem of decisi@@ on-@@ making sur@@ vei@@ llan@@ ce -- they &apos;re limited -- they &apos;re going to categ@@ ori@@ ze alterna@@ tives ; make it real -- categ@@ ori@@ ze it ; we can categ@@ ori@@ ze it -- we can avoid more with more categ@@ ories , less opportunities , prepar@@ ing for complexity . </s>
so every one of these techniques that i describe to you today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use it for yourself , good for the people who offer you service . </s>
because i believe that the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re selec@@ tively selec@@ tive . </s>
and the more we are selec@@ tively selec@@ tive , the better we will be able to make the art of choice . </s>
thank you . </s>
hi . i &apos;m kevin allo@@ c@@ ca ; i &apos;m looking at youtube mana@@ gers . i &apos;m looking at youtube videos . </s>
that &apos;s true . </s>
today , we want to talk about how video video videos are going to be , and then finally , why this is important . </s>
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- when i was young , it seemed so infin@@ itely difficult . </s>
but web videos have allowed that we all or all our creative activities can become in@@ san@@ e in a part of the world &apos;s culture . </s>
every single one of you could be famous about the internet and the next satur@@ day . </s>
but at youtube , more than 48 hours are u@@ plo@@ aded every minute . </s>
and again , just a tiny percentage of that is ever vir@@ ul@@ ated , and it &apos;s going to be thousands and thousands of times the cultural moment . </s>
so how does it work ? </s>
three things : ta@@ ste@@ maker , sub@@ se@@ me@@ tic communities and the unexpected communities . </s>
well , let &apos;s have a look . </s>
oh my god . oh my god . </s>
oh my god ! </s>
who@@ a ! </s>
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w ! </s>
last year , vas@@ vas@@ z sen@@ sed this video he had fil@@ med before his house in the yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park . </s>
in 2010 , it was 23 million times . </s>
this graph shows what it looked like when the video was first popular for the first summer . </s>
in fact , they didn &apos;t want to make a viral video . </s>
he just wanted to share a rain@@ bow . </s>
because you do that when you &apos;re called yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te mountain drive . </s>
he &apos;d u@@ plo@@ aded a lot of natural videos . </s>
and this video has actually been sent in january already . </s>
now , what has happened here ? </s>
there was j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ n . </s>
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ bert sen@@ ds the t@@ we@@ et who made the video so popular . </s>
because ta@@ ste@@ maker like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ ber makes us make new and interesting things and show them a big audience . </s>
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day . got@@ ta get down on fri@@ day fri@@ day . remember the wee@@ k@@ end to the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ k@@ end . fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day &apos; down on fri@@ day . you didn &apos;t think we &apos;d run this conversation without talking about this video , i hope . </s>
re@@ bec@@ ca bl@@ ac@@ ks &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year . </s>
it was considered almost 200 million times this year . </s>
this is what the graphics looked like . </s>
just like in &quot; double rain@@ bow , &quot; it seems to be coming out of nowhere . </s>
what happened that day on this day ? </s>
well , it was fri@@ day , it was true . </s>
if you want to know , those other ti@@ gers are also fri@@ days . </s>
but what about this day , this particular fri@@ day ? </s>
well , to@@ sh@@ .@@ zero for@@ got it , a lot of blogs started writing about it . </s>
michael j@@ . nelson from art science theater was a first person to make twitter a joke about it . </s>
what matters is that a single person or group of bri@@ bes makers took a point of view with a big audience and acceler@@ ated the process . </s>
and then this community of people who shared this big insi@@ der joke , and started talking about it and playing with it . </s>
now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; fri@@ day &quot; on youtube . </s>
so in the first seven days , there was a par@@ o@@ o for every single day of life . </s>
unlike the 20th century conversation of the 20th century , the participa@@ tion of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or making something new out of it . </s>
&quot; n@@ yan cat &quot; is animation and music in fin@@ e-@@ diving loop . </s>
it &apos;s very , very simple . </s>
this year , it was vie@@ wed almost 50 million times . </s>
and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-@@ hour version of it , which has been looked at four million times . </s>
so even cats look at this video . </s>
cats look at cats who look at this video . </s>
what is important is the creativity in the internet culture of tech@@ ie and hon@@ ored hon@@ ors . </s>
there were re@@ mix@@ es . </s>
somebody did an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned version of it . </s>
and then it became international . </s>
a whole re@@ mi@@ x community community was shooting from the ground that made it from a dum@@ b joke to something we could all participate in . </s>
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure enjo@@ ying anything , we &apos;re doing it . </s>
who would have been able to see that ? </s>
i mean , who would have predi@@ cted &quot; double rain@@ bow &quot; or &quot; n@@ yan cat &quot; or &quot; n@@ yan cat ? &quot; </s>
what scrip@@ ted books can you write about , which is the ur@@ gen@@ cy ? </s>
in a world where every minute of two days , video material will be u@@ plo@@ aded , there can only be unique and unexpected and unexpected videos . </s>
i admit , i &apos;m not very interested , when a friend told me i was watching this great video , about a guy who prote@@ sted in new york against bi@@ cycles for bi@@ cycles . </s>
i got a ticket because i was not driving on the bike , but often there are dis@@ abilities that don &apos;t always drive you to go on the bi@@ kes . </s>
because this was completely surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey ku@@ stat@@ s became funny and his argument looked five million times . </s>
this approach is true for all new things that we do creative . </s>
and that all leads to a big question ... </s>
what does that mean ? </s>
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h . </s>
what does that mean ? </s>
ta@@ ste@@ maker , creative partici@@ pat@@ ory communities , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture in which everyone has access and where the audience is popular . </s>
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- ju@@ stin bie@@ ber -- did his beginning at youtube . </s>
no one has to give your ideas green light . </s>
and today , we all feel the ow@@ ner@@ ship of our pop culture . </s>
and these are not the features of the old media , and they &apos;re barely coming to the media from today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future . </s>
thank you . </s>
how can i talk about the inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness between women over three generations , and how the amazing strength of this inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness was mani@@ fest itself in the lives of a four@@ -year-old girl , when she was sitting over 30 years ago with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother sitting together in a small boat in the chinese ocean , and a connec@@ tivity in life in the lives of this little girl and never disappeared anymore -- this little girl that lives in san francisco and talk to them today ? &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
the story is not over yet . </s>
it &apos;s a mystery that will be put together . </s>
i want to tell you about some of the pieces of puzzle . </s>
imagine the first piece : a man who bur@@ ns his life . </s>
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was held together by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home . </s>
if you think of it as the communic@@ ator of the communic@@ ators in sa@@ ig@@ on , how he has to admit that his life was a single waste . </s>
the words , as long as his friends , now mo@@ unt his own . </s>
he pulled back into silence . </s>
he died , broken through history . </s>
he &apos;s my grandfather . </s>
i never met him personally . </s>
but our lives are so much more than our memories . </s>
my grandmother never for@@ gotten me his life . </s>
i had to make sure it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to cr@@ ush us , but we passed it through . </s>
the next piece of puzzle is how to run a boat in the early morning red tu@@ bes in the ocean . </s>
my mother ma@@ i was 18 when her father died -- in an ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , with two little girls . </s>
for them , life had given her a task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia . </s>
it was completely complete that it could fail . </s>
after a four@@ -year-old film and film sa@@ ga came a boat on the sea , tar@@ ge@@ ted fishing boat . </s>
all the adults were aware of the risks . </s>
the greatest fear was they had pir@@ ates , ra@@ pe and death . </s>
like most adults on the boat , my mother got a little closer bottle bottle . </s>
when a prison@@ er would have had my sister and i , she and i dr@@ ank her and my grandmother . </s>
my first memories are from this boat -- the ste@@ aling tu@@ ck@@ on of the engine , the cla@@ pping of every wave on the front , the distance and empty hori@@ zon . </s>
i don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates that many times came , but i won &apos;t dec@@ ei@@ ve from the death gu@@ ards on our boat on our boat , or at the end of the engine , who didn &apos;t want to start six hours . </s>
but i remember the lights of the mal@@ ay@@ an coast of mal@@ ay@@ an coast , and the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and on the taste of the first apple that gave me one of the men on the platform . </s>
no apple ever s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed that way . </s>
after three months in a refuge@@ e camp , we landed in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne . </s>
and the next piece of puzzle is about four women in three generations building together a new life . </s>
we went into football in foot@@ sc@@ ray , which is one of the work@@ -@@ class sub@@ ur@@ bs that are made of im@@ migr@@ ant layers . </s>
unlike in the middle of the middle class medi@@ cin@@ es , the existence of me was completely unknown , there wasn &apos;t a challenge in football . </s>
the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of the la@@ wn boxes come from the rest of the world . </s>
and the fe@@ a@@ thers of broken english were swa@@ pped between people who had one thing in common : they started new . </s>
my mother worked on far@@ ms , then on a assembly line in a car factory , six days , dou@@ ble@@ -@@ layers . </s>
they somehow managed to find their time to use english and i.@@ t. quali@@ fi@@ cations . </s>
we were poor . </s>
every dollar has been deli@@ vered and pus@@ hed into another education for english and mathematics , no matter what we &apos;ve had to do , and most of the stuff was the new stuff that came out of two hand . </s>
two few str@@ ings of school for the school , each to cover the holes in the other . </s>
a school uni@@ form to the butt@@ ons , because it had to reach six years . </s>
and there were the rare but painful cho@@ irs of &quot; close eye &quot; and here and roll@@ s , &quot; asi@@ an , goes home . &quot; </s>
home where ? </s>
something bigger in me . </s>
there was a meeting with recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ation and a quiet voice saying , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of my way . &quot; </s>
my mom , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed . </s>
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted every night , but we told each other about our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house . </s>
my mother suff@@ ered al@@ p@@ dreams from the boat . </s>
and it was my job every night to stay a@@ wake until your night@@ mar@@ es came so i could open them up . </s>
she opened a computer business , then went into a cos@@ me@@ tic training , and she opened up a business here . </s>
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t take change , angry and un@@ flexible , and sor@@ ted kids , tra@@ pped between two worlds . </s>
lo@@ ans and spon@@ sor@@ s have been searching . </s>
centers were built . </s>
i lived in parallel worlds . </s>
in one , i was the classic asi@@ an student , who was the in@@ cen@@ tive dem@@ o of himself . </s>
in the other hand , i was involved in un@@ certain lives , the tra@@ gic sc@@ ars of violence , the drug abuse and the insu@@ lation . </s>
but there were so many years of help over this year . </s>
and because of this help , i was reje@@ cted in law school as a young austr@@ ali@@ an of the year last year . </s>
and i was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from one piece to the next cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted , and the ed@@ ges didn &apos;t fit together . </s>
tan le , anony@@ mous tra@@ w@@ ler of football , was now tan , refuge@@ e and social activ@@ ist who was invited to places that she had never heard of , and in housing , whose existence it could never have imagined . </s> &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
i wasn &apos;t familiar with the lab@@ els . </s>
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bri@@ ck . </s>
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine . </s>
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything . </s>
i wanted to go back to the r@@ out@@ ine and the conveni@@ ence of the life of an unknown sub@@ ur@@ b -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who every day for her days for 20 years , by telling each other the stories of her day , told each other the stories of her day , we still as@@ sign , we still three still in the same bed . </s>
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that . </s>
and she reminded me that i was now as old as we got the boat up there . </s>
no , no one has ever been an opportunity . </s>
&quot; do it just , &quot; she said . &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot; </s>
so i was talking about ju@@ g@@ gling and training , and the ne@@ gle@@ cted of mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized and de@@ pos@@ ited . </s>
and the more i talked , the more i should tell . </s>
i met people in all life , so many of them did what they loved , lived in the limits of the possible possible . </s>
and although i gradu@@ ated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t find a career with a career in law . </s>
there had to be a different piece of music . </s>
and i realized at the same time that it was okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a new@@ l@@ ling , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but something you need to be gr@@ ateful for , maybe a gift of the boat . </s>
because there can be so easily to collapse on the hori@@ zon of the hori@@ zon that you can accept the assu@@ mp@@ tions of the environment . </s>
i &apos;ve gone from my conveni@@ ence to know that , yes , the world is collap@@ sing , but not the way you fear it . </s>
opportunities that would not have been allowed were expli@@ cit@@ ly encoura@@ ged . </s>
there was a energy , an in@@ conveni@@ ent optimis@@ m , a strange mix@@ ture of the humili@@ ty and the wa@@ g@@ ders . </s>
so i decided to follow my gut feeling . </s>
i collected a small team of people around me , for which the sho@@ e is not &quot; an un@@ fortunate challenge . &quot; </s>
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a cent . </s>
at the end of a day , i could do a giant top@@ ian sou@@ p that we shared . </s>
we worked till late to night . </s>
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were some brilliant ones out there , and we made the break@@ through . </s>
i met the decision to go to the united states . </s>
after just a journey there . </s>
my gut feel back . </s>
three months later , i was moved by , and the ad@@ venture continued to go . </s>
before i close this talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother . </s>
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m , and the local mand@@ ar@@ in was the most important person . </s>
life had not changed for centuries . </s>
her father died shor@@ tly after her birth . </s>
her mother moved her alone . </s>
at 17 , she became the second woman of a mand@@ ar@@ in , whose mother beat her . </s>
without support of their men , she was worried about sen@@ sing by bringing him to court in their own case and pun@@ ched in their own case , and an even bigger sen@@ sation than she won . </s>
&quot; don &apos;t go &quot; turns out to be un@@ true . </s>
i just du@@ cked in a hotel room in sy@@ dney when she died . 1,000 miles away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne . </s>
i looked down through the du@@ tch , and i looked at it on the other side . </s>
i knew she came to say she was good@@ b@@ ye . </s>
my mother called me a couple of minutes after that . </s>
a few days later , we walked into a budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in football and sitting around their co@@ g . </s>
we told her stories and we made her stories that we were still with her . </s>
and at mid@@ night , the mon@@ k came and said he had to close the sar@@ g . </s>
my mother asked us to grab her hand . </s>
and she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot; </s>
&quot; because you &apos;re holding it tomorrow , &quot; he said . </s>
&quot; they haven &apos;t left them . &quot; </s>
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it pas@@ ses through the women . </s>
you can see who we were and how life shaped us , we can now see that the men who &apos;d come to our lives would have come into the cro@@ ps . </s>
the defe@@ at would have been too simple . </s>
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i &apos;m still thinking of the boat . </s>
who would ever wish ? </s>
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , i &apos;m scared , i &apos;m in the business of che@@ ating . </s>
can i give you a bug in your life , the coura@@ geous every wave of every wave , the squ@@ ir@@ rel , ste@@ aling of the engine of the engine , the big hori@@ zon that doesn &apos;t guaran@@ tee you ? </s>
i don &apos;t know . </s>
but if i could give that and make it safe , i would do it . </s>
also , t@@ an &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or fifth series . </s>
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you . </s>
is it even photography ? </s>
because that , of course , is a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera . </s>
yet , my interest in photography when i received my first digital camera , at the age of 15 , at the age of 15 . </s>
i combined it with my earlier pre@@ ference for drawing , but it was a little different , because when the camera was using the camera , the process was actually in planning . </s>
and when you take a picture up with a camera , the process ends up when you press the trig@@ ger . </s>
so for me photography , it seemed to be more about being in the right place at the right time . </s>
i believed everybody could do that . </s>
so i wanted to create something else , something that the process begins when the trig@@ ger is expres@@ sed . </s>
photos like this : a construction site along a much ri@@ ding road . </s>
but it has an unexpected twi@@ st . </s>
and yet , bri@@ ck@@ les is a reali@@ stic way . </s>
or photographs like this -- dark and color@@ ful at the same time , but everyone with the common goal to keep a reali@@ stic level . </s>
when i say reality , i mean phot@@ o-@@ reality . </s>
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can really capture , but i always want to make it look like you might have had , in a photograph . </s>
photographs where you have to think about a short moment to figure out the trick . </s>
so it &apos;s more about starting an idea as a moment . </s>
but what is the trick that makes it real reali@@ stic ? </s>
is it about the details or the color ? </s>
is it about light ? </s>
what makes the illusion ? </s>
sometimes the perspective is the illusion . </s>
but in the end , it &apos;s about how we interpre@@ t the world , and how it can be made on a two-@@ dimensional surface . </s>
it &apos;s not about what is reali@@ stic , but what we think of as reali@@ stic . </s>
so i think the foun@@ da@@ tions are very simple . </s>
i see you as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put together in order to create an alternative reality . </s>
and let me show you a simple example . </s>
we have three perfectly imagin@@ able physical objects that we can identify with all of us in a three-dimensional world . </s>
but in a certain way , you can create something that looks still three-dimensional as if it could exist . </s>
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible . </s>
so we &apos;re che@@ cking our brains , because our brains simply don &apos;t accept it , that it doesn &apos;t really make sense . </s>
and i see the same process in combine photographs of photos . </s>
it &apos;s really just about making different reali@@ ties . </s>
so the things that make a picture reali@@ stic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t really think about , the things around us in our everyday lives . </s>
but when we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they &apos;re just looking kind of wrong . </s>
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow in order to achieve a reali@@ stic outcome . </s>
as you can see , these are not three special images . </s>
but combined something like this , but you can create something special as this . </s>
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective . </s>
second , combin@@ ing photos should have the same ill@@ um@@ ination species . </s>
and these two pictures are ful@@ filling these two dem@@ ands -- shot out of the same al@@ titude , and the same ill@@ n@@ esses . </s>
third is about making it impossible , where the individual images begin , where the individual images begin and end by connecting them se@@ am@@ less@@ ly . </s>
make it impossible to say how the photograph was actually put together . </s>
so by looking at color , contrast and hel@@ pl@@ ess at the ed@@ ges of the individual images , photogra@@ phic men add up , like field depth and disorders and disorders , we look at the limit@@ ations between the various images and let them look like a single picture , even though a picture can basically con@@ tain hundreds of levels of levels . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
here &apos;s another example . </s>
you may think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom part is mani@@ pul@@ ated . </s>
but this picture is actually completely comp@@ iled from photographs in different places . </s>
i personally find that it &apos;s easier to create a place than find a place , because you don &apos;t have to com@@ promise com@@ promise to the ideas in your head . </s>
but it requires a lot of planning . </s>
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i would take several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle . </s>
for example , the fish was taken on a boo@@ k@@ store . </s>
the bank is coming from a different place . </s>
the underwater section is a quar@@ ry quar@@ ry . </s>
and yes , i even put the house up on the island on the island to make it look swe@@ dish . </s>
so to make a reali@@ stic result , it comes from me to see planning on planning . </s>
i always start with a fan@@ cy , an idea . </s>
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images . </s>
and here , every piece has been very well plan@@ ned . </s>
and if you make good images , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite reali@@ stic . </s>
so there are all the tools available , and the only thing that li@@ sts us is our imagination . </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects failed . </s>
and i think the most important part of this is that we &apos;ve stopped talking with our patients . </s>
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced at the bi@@ b@@ ou@@ d university was to hire a major audience . </s>
she doesn &apos;t do particularly scienti@@ fically -- she puts a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , families , families , rela@@ tives , &quot; how do you do it ? </s>
how do we help you ? &quot; </s>
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everyone -- maybe most of the electronic health projects failed : because we &apos;ve stopped listening . </s>
this is my w@@ lan@@ -@@ scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing . </s>
she &apos;s got a button , at an hour . </s>
and every morning i jum@@ ped on that . </s>
and yeah , i have a problem , as you might recognize . </s>
i &apos;ve put my job in eight pounds . </s>
it works very simply : every time i stick on the scale , it will send my data on google health . </s>
and that &apos;s where they &apos;re called from my general doctor to see where my weight problems are , not only in the moment where i need car@@ di@@ ological support or something , but also with a view of the past . </s>
but there is something else . </s>
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this . i &apos;ve got over 4,000 follo@@ wers on twitter . </s>
so every morning i ski@@ p on my wee@@ k@@ ly a@@ ven@@ ue , and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch , just a little sal@@ ad today , lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot; </s>
but this is the number one thing that can happen , because this is the group of groups , this is the group to help patients , because that could be used for obesity , or it could cut patients off the smo@@ oth . </s>
but it could also be used to get the people out of their cha@@ irs , and get them to play some kind of play together to control their health better . </s>
and next week it &apos;s going to be on the market . </s>
there &apos;s going to be this little blood ves@@ sel device that you put in an iphone or something like that . </s>
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , send it to their physi@@ cian and share it with others , for example , for a little more than 100 dollars . </s>
at this point , the patients are coming in . they can &apos;t just take control again , they can be capit@@ alized on their own ship , but we can also help health care with the challenges that are happening in front of us , and the cost of health care , twice , and so on . </s>
make methods that are easy to use , and you start to hu@@ g them with this one , hu@@ gging patients in the team . </s>
and they can do that through these techniques , but also by crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing . </s>
and one of the things we &apos;ve done is i &apos;d like to share with you a quick video . </s>
we have all the navi@@ gation systems in our cars . </s>
maybe even in our mobile phones . </s>
we know exactly where all the at@@ ms around the world are ma@@ xi@@ stri@@ zing . </s>
we know one more thing where all the gas stations are . </s>
and sure enough , we can find fast food cha@@ ins . </s>
but where would the next a@@ ed be to help this patient ? </s>
we were asking around , and no one knew it . </s>
no one knew where the next life-@@ saving a@@ ed was at that moment . </s>
so what did we do ? we &apos;ve done crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing in the ne@@ ther@@ lands . </s>
we &apos;ve built a website and asked a human mass , &quot; when you see an a@@ ed , please share with us where he is , when he has , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed in business , of course . </s>
and over 10,000 stories have been reported in the ne@@ ther@@ lands . </s>
the next step was to find the apps for this . </s>
and we designed an i@@ pad app . </s>
we &apos;ve developed an app for la@@ y@@ ar , and we &apos;ve exp@@ anded reality to find these things . </s>
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ gers and somebody collap@@ ses , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple weeks you can also find your micro@@ phones to find the next a@@ ven@@ ue that can save lives . </s>
and today , we don &apos;t just want to introduce this as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u , how the product is called , but also as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us . </s>
and we want to bring this to a global scale . </s>
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universi@@ ties , to help us behave like k@@ is@@ sing points to crow@@ d@@ source these nations around the world . </s>
and if you &apos;re in vac@@ ation and someone collap@@ ses , it can be your own relationships or somebody else , you can find an a@@ ed . </s>
the other thing we want to ask is that companies around the world are helping us with the con@@ fir@@ mation of these nations . </s>
these could be car@@ ri@@ age services , or techni@@ cians for example , just to make sure that the a@@ ge-@@ old a@@ unt is still in his place . </s>
please help us do this , and try and improve health health , but take in your hands . </s>
thank you . </s>
today i &apos;m going to report an unexpected discoveries . </s>
i work in the solar technology industry . </s>
and my little star@@ tu@@ p wants us to force ourselves in the environment by ... </s>
... it &apos;s the crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing . </s>
here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing . </s>
oh . hold on . </s>
it may take , until it &apos;s lo@@ aded . </s>
now -- we can just ski@@ p this out -- i &apos;m just going to ski@@ p the video ... </s>
no . </s>
it &apos;s not ... </s>
okay . </s>
solar technology ... </s>
oh , my time is over ? </s>
okay . thank you . </s>
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year out of time and work in an environment that is pretty much what they actually hate , we &apos;ve let them work in the government . </s>
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the peace gee@@ ks for computer gee@@ ks . </s>
we choose some fel@@ lows every year , and we let them work with urban management . </s>
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in city hall users . </s>
and there they developed great apps working with urban employees . </s>
but what you really do is show what is possible with technology today . </s>
so meet al . </s>
al is a hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston . </s>
it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really is looking for is someone who fre@@ es him out when he reach@@ es him , because he knows that he &apos;s not very good at fire when it &apos;s covered by a meter of snow . </s>
how did he get in search of this particular way for help ? </s>
we had a team of fel@@ lows in boston last year called &quot; code for america &quot; program . </s>
they were there in febru@@ ary , and there was a lot of work in febru@@ ary last febru@@ ary . </s>
and they realized that the city never sh@@ ines the hy@@ dr@@ ant . </s>
but a particular fellow , a man named er@@ ik michael el@@ er , noticed something else , and that was the resi@@ dent that the side@@ walks were free , right in front of them , right in front of these parts . </s>
so he did what any good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an app . </s>
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adop@@ t a hy@@ dr@@ ant . </s>
you agreed to s@@ ni@@ ff him free when it comes down . </s>
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al . </s>
if you don &apos;t do that , then somebody can take you away . </s>
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic . </s>
this is a mo@@ dest little app . </s>
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of 21 apps that the fel@@ lows wrote in the last year . </s>
but it does something that no other government technology does . </s>
it spre@@ ads very rapidly . </s>
there &apos;s this guy in the i.@@ t. di@@ vision of the city of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who saw that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adop@@ t the citizens of tsunami si@@ zed . </s>
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami si@@ ts work , but people ste@@ al the batter@@ ies . </s>
so he got the citizens to check them . </s>
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean the clo@@ gged gul@@ ls . </s>
and chicago has just introduced it to release the bu@@ mp@@ s of the bu@@ tter@@ fly when it comes up . </s>
we now know nine cities that plan to use this app . </s>
and it has spread ru@@ th@@ less , organic , of course . </s>
when you know about government technology , you know , it usually doesn &apos;t work like this . </s>
the cap@@ ability of software takes a couple of years to do this . </s>
we had a team that worked on a project last year in boston , for the three people two and a half months . </s>
it was a way of finding the parents to find out what the right public schools are for their kids . </s>
we were later told that if it went over the normal chan@@ nels , it would have taken over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars . </s>
and that &apos;s nothing at all . </s>
there &apos;s a project right now in the california law that the tax@@ pa@@ yer cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work . </s>
and there are projects like this at every level of the government . </s>
so an app that was written in a few days , and then it spread from sel@@ fish , is a kind of k@@ is@@ sing shot on the front of the government . </s>
it shows how the government could work better -- no more than a private company , how many people think it should be . </s>
and not even like a tech company , but rather like the internet itself . </s>
and that means free access , which means open and productive . </s>
and this is important . </s>
but more importantly on this app , she represents a new generation that attra@@ cts the problem of government -- not as the problem of a sales institution , but as a problem of collective action . </s>
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at doing digital technology with digital technology . </s>
now there &apos;s a large community of people who are making the tools that we need to put things together . </s>
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fel@@ lows , there are hundreds of people around the country writing up and writing government apps every day in their own communities . </s>
they didn &apos;t give up the government . </s>
they &apos;re terri@@ bly fru@@ strated with her , but they don &apos;t compla@@ in about it , they repair it . </s>
and these guys know something that we &apos;ve lost out of the eyes . </s>
and that is , if you have all your feelings about politics and the sna@@ ke at work and all the other things we really care about , government , in the core , in the words of tim o &apos;@@ rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we &apos;re doing together , we can &apos;t do that alone . &quot; </s>
today , a lot of people have given up the government . </s>
and when you &apos;re one of those people , i want you to think about it , because things change . </s>
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is changing . </s>
and because the government finally puts their power out of us -- remember , &quot; we remember the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it will affect how this change happens . </s>
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program . </s>
and like a lot of people , i thought that government is mainly about choo@@ sing people to vote . </s>
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s particularly pool for th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ines . </s>
this is the call center for service and information . </s>
that &apos;s where you usually get out when you fall in your town in 3@@ 11 . </s>
if you ever have the chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott sil@@ ver@@ man as part of the program -- in fact , you do all this -- you will see that the people who call the government for many different problems , including a th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine in their house . </s>
so scott &apos;s got this fru@@ strated . </s>
he ti@@ ps &quot; th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine &quot; into the official datab@@ ase . </s>
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the animal &apos;s animal . </s>
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if that live@@ stock skin skin ? &quot; </s>
and that worked . appl@@ ause for scott . </s>
but this was not the end of the th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine . </s>
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center . </s>
it has an app , a web and hand@@ -@@ app called &quot; citizens . &quot; </s>
we didn &apos;t write the app . </s>
this is the work of very smart people at the office of the new urban mechan@@ ics office in boston . </s>
one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine in my trash bag . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead . </s>
how do i get them away ? &quot; </s>
but what happens to citizens aid is different . </s>
scott under@@ went from human to human . </s>
but the citi@@ zen@@ ship is all public , so that anyone can see it . </s>
and in this case , it was a neighbor . </s>
and the next post that we got , &quot; i went down there , &quot; found the trash behind the house . </s>
mar@@ su@@ pi@@ al ? yes . alive ? y@@ ap . </s>
turn the trash ton to the side . go home . </s>
good night , cute th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine . &quot; </s>
pretty simple . </s>
that &apos;s great . this is where the digital hits the physical . </s>
and it &apos;s also a good example of getting the government into crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing . </s>
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform . </s>
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform here . </s>
i &apos;m more talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help themselves . </s>
a citizens helped other citizens , but the government played a central role here . </s>
they connected and they connected these two people . </s>
and you could be able to connect them with government if they needed , but a neighbor is a much better and cheaper alternative to government services . </s>
when a neighbor suppor@@ ts the other , we em@@ power our communities . </s>
let &apos;s call the animal catch , it costs a lot of money . </s>
one of the key things is that we have to think about this , that government is not the same as politics . </s>
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input from the other . </s>
that our contribu@@ tion to the system is choo@@ sing . </s>
how many times did we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we go back and we expect that the government , our values , refle@@ cts our values and our needs , and then not much changed . </s>
this is because government is like a higher ocean , and politics is the top six inches . </s>
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bure@@ au@@ cra@@ cy . </s>
and we use this word with such con@@ temp@@ t . </s>
but it &apos;s this con@@ temp@@ t that this thing that we own , and that we pay for , make something that works against us , works something different , and then we took ourselves ourselves . </s>
people seem to think , politics is sexy . </s>
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bure@@ au@@ cra@@ cy sexy . </s>
because this is where the real government work is happening . </s>
we need to let ourselves go to the machin@@ ery of the government . </s>
so the occu@@ pa@@ thetic movement , it has done it . </s>
have you seen these guys ? </s>
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens who wrote a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report , which is an answer to the se@@ c membran@@ e about the law of financial reform . </s>
this is not poli@@ tically active , which is bure@@ au@@ cra@@ tic active . </s>
now , for those of us that the government has given up , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we &apos;re trying to leave behind our children . </s>
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to face . </s>
do we really believe that what we need to do without impro@@ ving an institution that can act in the name of all of us ? </s>
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient . </s>
the good news is that technology makes it possible to deeply interpre@@ t the function of the government in a way that can actually do something by empower@@ ing society . </s>
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up on the internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you have to build the right systems . </s>
now the average age of our fel@@ lows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you . </s>
this is a generation that grew up seeing their voice for granted . </s>
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we &apos;re all fighting about to talk about ; they &apos;re all supposed to speak . </s>
you can tell your opinion , on every channel at any time , and you do . </s>
so , when you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices . </s>
you use your hands . </s>
they use their hands to write applications that impro@@ ves the work of the government . </s>
and these apps make us use our hands to improve our communities . </s>
it could be a hy@@ dr@@ ant , a hy@@ dr@@ ant hy@@ dr@@ ant , to h@@ unt a trash with a th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine with a th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine . </s>
and sure , we would have released these hy@@ dr@@ ans all the time , and a lot of people do that . </s>
but these apps are like little digital memories , that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government paying tax ta@@ xes and services . </s>
we are more than that , we are citizens . </s>
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the citi@@ zen@@ ship . </s>
so the question i have for you all here : when it comes to the big , important things we have to do together , all together , are we going to be a lot of voices , or will we also be a lot of hands ? </s>
thank you . </s>
normally my role in telling people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming up will be . and i thought , since i &apos;m here in friends , i would tell you what i really think . and also try to look back and understand what &apos;s going on here , with these incredible jum@@ ps , which are so quickly , that we can barely keep up with them . </s>
i &apos;m going to start showing you a single , boring , boring slide . </s>
... if you could show the slide for a second . </s>
this is a slide i happened to choose from my fol@@ k . </s>
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide here ; it &apos;s actually about the gener@@ ic form . </s>
this slide shows us an analysis of ris@@ ky process@@ ors compared to the power of a local area networks of networks . </s>
now what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like this slide , which we often meet in our field , is a kind of se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ arith@@ mic curve . </s>
in other words , every step here is a power in the performance scale . </s>
and this is a no@@ vel@@ ty that we have to use this guy scale to se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ arith@@ mic cur@@ ves in the field of technology . </s>
there &apos;s something very strange happening here . </s>
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here . </s>
so , if you could turn the lights back up again . </s>
another bri@@ ghter , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here . </s>
now , why do we draw gra@@ pher@@ s in technology for se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ arith@@ mic cur@@ ves ? </s>
the reason for this is that if i draw it on a normal curve , where , you know , these are the years , so the ti@@ mel@@ ine of one kind , and this is a random measure of the technology that i want to show you in a graph , then the graph is going to be sil@@ ly . </s>
they look like this . </s>
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot . </s>
so if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transport technology , which would be very reas@@ onable in the se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ arith@@ mic scale , in the form of a flat line . </s>
but if there &apos;s anything like this , it changes qual@@ it@@ ative conditions . </s>
so if transportation technology would continue as quickly as the micro@@ process@@ or technology would continue , then we could go into a tax@@ i in a tax@@ i , and in 30 seconds we would be in to@@ k@@ yo . </s>
but it doesn &apos;t do that fast . </s>
this has never been before in the history of technology development , this sort of rec@@ ur@@ sive growth , through which the mag@@ ni@@ tude every few years increases exponenti@@ ally . </s>
so the question that i want to ask you now is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , you see they don &apos;t go forever . </s>
it &apos;s not possible that everything for forever and forever is moving forward as fast as we can . </s>
there are two options . </s>
either it &apos;s going to be a classic curve like this , until something completely different , or it will happen here . </s>
that &apos;s about it . </s>
so , i &apos;m an opti@@ mist , so i think this is what i think is going to happen in the way that i happen here . </s>
if that &apos;s true , that means we &apos;re right here in the middle of a transition transition . </s>
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the very far world to a new kind of world . </s>
so the question that i want to ask , and i often ask myself , is this new world going to be good ? </s>
what is this new state that takes the world very slowly ? </s>
because the transition seems to be very , very conf@@ using when you &apos;re in the middle of it . </s>
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in the year 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 . </s>
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and they realize that the future is still going to be in 2000 . </s>
moving away from that , we don &apos;t . </s>
so in other words , the future has shr@@ unk by a year since i am in this world . </s>
and i think the reason for this is that we know that something is in the gan@@ ge . </s>
the transition happens . we can feel it all . </s>
and we know that right now , it just doesn &apos;t make sense to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything will be so different , that a very simple amount of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense of what we &apos;re doing now . </s>
now i want to talk about what that might be , this transition that we &apos;re in right now . </s>
and to do that , i &apos;ll first talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have anything to do with technology or computers . </s>
because i think to really understand this , we have to take a step back and look at this thing in a longer scale . </s>
and that &apos;s what i want to look at at the time scale of life on earth . </s>
i think the big picture makes sense when you divide it into a few billion steps . </s>
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s 2.@@ 5 billion years . the earth has been a big , ster@@ ile quar@@ ry with a lot of floating chemicals . </s>
now if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good image of how they did that . </s>
and i think there are theor@@ ies that start to understand how everything has started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simpli@@ stic story which is that at this time , little oil sp@@ ills conta@@ ined around that conta@@ ined different kinds of reci@@ pes for chemicals . </s>
some of these oil sp@@ ills conta@@ ined a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integra@@ te other chemicals from the outside and grow them . </s>
everybody they were , started sharing . </s>
these little oil dro@@ ple@@ ts were the most primitive cell form . </s>
however , these oil sp@@ ills were not about living in today &apos;s current sense , because every one of them was just a small , random reci@@ pe of chemicals . </s>
and every time it divided , the chemicals in there have been spread to un@@ equal quanti@@ ties . </s>
so every dro@@ ple@@ t was a little different . </s>
in fact , the dro@@ ple@@ ts , which had one for the growth of opti@@ mal com@@ position , had faster than others and integr@@ ating more and more chemicals from outside and divided them faster . </s>
so these ten@@ ds to survive longer , and they increased at much greater scale . </s>
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but it &apos;s more interesting when these dro@@ ple@@ ts learn a trick about abstra@@ ction . </s>
in fact , a way that we don &apos;t quite understand , these dro@@ ple@@ ts have learned the ability to de@@ code information . </s>
they &apos;ve learned to store the reci@@ pe of the cell as a information , and it &apos;s in a particular chemical shape that we call dna . </s>
in other words , in this mini@@ mal , evolutionary way , they found a way that they allowed them to write down , so that this information stor@@ ed them , so that this information could be stor@@ ed and cop@@ ied . </s>
and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information information is stor@@ ed over the time of 2.@@ 5 billion years where it was born , stuck in the same way . </s>
in fact , the reci@@ pe for us is our genes , from the exact same code and the same writing . </s>
and every species use the exact same letters and the same code . </s>
we are so far that we can write , just for ourselves , for the pleasure of this code . </s>
and i &apos;ve got 100 micro@@ gram of a white pul@@ se here , which i &apos;m trying to do in the air@@ por@@ ts of security systems . </s>
and that &apos;s what i did -- what i did is i took this code -- the code consi@@ sts of normal letters that we use to symbo@@ lic -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna , and i am@@ pli@@ fied it 10 times 22 times . </s>
so if someone wants a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i have enough enough for anyone in this room and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here . </s>
if i was really a sel@@ fish in fact , i would have written them on a virus and released them into space . </s>
so what &apos;s the next step ? </s>
the de@@ ple@@ tion of dna was an interesting step . </s>
and that &apos;s what these cells have done -- that made them happy for another billion years . </s>
but then another very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that was that these cells started to communicate and exchange information so that communities came from cells of cells . </s>
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually share their dna . </s>
this is also the reason why , for example , the consi@@ sten@@ cy of antibio@@ tics is increasing . </s>
some bacteria have found how they can go from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and have written this information together with other bacteria in dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin because the bacteria communicate with each other . </s>
this communication allowed the reasons of communities , which were in a certain sense of the same boat ; they were sy@@ ner@@ ac@@ tic . </s>
so they either survi@@ ved together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals in the community were going to have more repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly repe@@ ated and pre@@ fer@@ red by evolution . </s>
the head@@ line is where these communities are so close together , that they decided to write the reci@@ pe for the whole community into a drawing chain of dna . </s>
and the next interesting phase took about a billion years . </s>
at this point , we have mul@@ tic@@ ell@@ ular communities , communities of many different cell types , which are together together as individual organism . </s>
in fact , we are also a mul@@ tic@@ ell@@ ular community . </s>
we have many cells which are no longer available on their own . </s>
your skin cells are us@@ eless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on . </s>
so these communities started to continue , so that the level in which evolution took place , no longer the single cell , but the whole cell community , which we call organism . </s>
the next step was now within these communities . </s>
the cell communities started to abstract information again . </s>
and they developed special structures , which made nothing different than processing information within the organism . </s>
and these are the neural structures . </s>
so the neurons are the information processing place that has built these cell communities . </s>
they started building speci@@ alists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and main@@ taining information . </s>
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities . </s>
this gave them an evolutionary advantage . </s>
because at this point in time an individual -- learning happened within the period of the life of a single organism , rather than about this evolutionary period . </s>
so one organism , for example , was learning not to eat a particular fruit , because it ta@@ stes bad@@ ly and made it sick , the last time he ate it . </s>
this could now happen within the lifes@@ pan of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because that information had to be learned from the individuals that died because of those fru@@ its , because these information structures were not there yet . </s>
so , the nervous system has been using the evolutionary process with this particular information structures because evolution could now take place within an individual . </s>
it could take place within a ti@@ m@@ ely learning framework . </s>
what happened next is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other . </s>
so for example , the most re@@ fin@@ ed version of this communication is the human language . </s>
it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention when you think about it . </s>
i have a very complicated , un@@ reas@@ onable and conf@@ used idea in my head . </s>
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically trying to create some basic sounds of creating a similar idea of creating a similar idea in your mind that has a certain res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce to my original idea . </s>
so we take something very complicated , put it in sound , turn it into a sequence of sound , and we produce something very complicated in the heads of the others . </s>
so this allows us to function again as a uni@@ fied organism . </s>
and what we &apos;ve actually done , we &apos;ve done humanity , is we &apos;ve started to abstract . </s>
we &apos;re going through the same stages that multi-@@ cell organisms have gone through -- the abstra@@ ction of our methods , how we hold data , present , process , process . </s>
for example , the invention of language was a little step in that direction . </s>
tele@@ ph@@ ony , computers , video games , c@@ d ro@@ ms and so on are all of our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we &apos;ve built in our community to do this information . </s>
and it conne@@ cts us all together to something that is much bigger , and also able to evolve faster than we &apos;ve been so far . </s>
so today , evolution can happen in the sp@@ an of micro@@ seconds . </s>
you &apos;ve also seen t@@ ys &apos;s little evolutionary example where he showed a little bit of evolution in the con@@ vol@@ ution program , right in front of your eyes . </s>
so now we &apos;ve re@@ covered the ti@@ mel@@ ine . </s>
the first steps of the story i told you was th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly a billion years ago . </s>
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , d@@ ated several hundred million years . </s>
then the next steps , like language and so on , we@@ t less than a million years . </s>
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking a few decades . </s>
the process is feeding by itself , and so , i think , auto@@ -@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for -- if something rein@@ forced its change to change . </s>
the more it changes , the faster it changes . </s>
and i think this is what we see here in this explo@@ ding curve . </s>
we see the process that is feeding by itself . </s>
i live professional computers , and i know that i could build the mechanism that i &apos;m using computers to build computers without the recent advan@@ ces in computer technology . </s>
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design it in a traditional way . </s>
i don &apos;t know what every single transi@@ stor does in the bon@@ ding machine . </s>
it has billions of them . </s>
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking machines do is , we think in a certain kind of abstract level of abstra@@ ction , that machine makes this machine , and the machine does something that ex@@ ce@@ eds our cap@@ abilities , better and faster than we might ever make it . </s>
and it makes it part of the methods that we don &apos;t even understand until now . </s>
one way which is particularly interesting , and that i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in the last time , is evolution itself . </s>
and we &apos;re inst@@ all@@ ing an evolutionary process in this machine that &apos;s going on in the micro@@ second area . </s>
so to give an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that evol@@ ves from random instruc@@ tions . </s>
we say , &quot; computers , maybe a hundred million random@@ ly chosen sequ@@ ences of instruc@@ tions . </s>
now , please lead all these random@@ ly chosen instruc@@ tions , run all the programs , and eventually choose the ones that are the clo@@ s@@ est . &quot; </s>
so in other words , i first define what i want . </s>
let &apos;s say i want to make numbers , which is a simple example that i used to use for it . </s>
so find programs that can do the most on the most . </s>
of course , the chance in random elected instruc@@ tions is very small , that they make numbers of random numbers , so probably none of the instruc@@ tions will actually do that . </s>
but one of them might happiness with something happiness in the right order of the right order . </s>
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequ@@ ences that i came to the clo@@ s@@ est to the next . </s>
store them , dele@@ te the rest . </s>
now all the rest of the people who &apos;ve been making numbers are the best ones . </s>
and it was with a method of re@@ combin@@ ing , analo@@ g to re@@ production . &quot; </s>
take two programs , and they produce kids through the exchange of their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the kids inher@@ it the features of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es of the two programs . </s>
so , i &apos;ve been a new generation of programs that have come through combin@@ ations of programs that have come a little closer than others . </s>
say , &quot; please repe@@ at this process . &quot; </s>
evalu@@ ating them again . </s>
leaders might lead some mu@@ tations . </s>
and try this again with a different generation . </s>
all of those generations are going to take a few milli@@ seconds just a few milli@@ seconds . </s>
and so i can run an evolution over millions of years into the computer within a few minutes , or in more complicated cases a few hours . </s>
finally , i get programs that can perfect numbers perfectly . </s>
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever have written by hand . </s>
when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell how they work . </s>
i &apos;ve tried to understand them . </s>
these are for@@ bi@@ dden and curious programs . </s>
but they do the job . </s>
i know and i &apos;m sure they &apos;re doing a job because they &apos;re coming out of a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job . </s>
because their lives were hanging out of whether they were doing the job properly . </s>
i sat in a 7@@ 47 together with mar@@ vin min@@ sky , where he high@@ lights a map and says , &quot; oh look . look at this . </s>
it says , &quot; this airplane is made up of hundreds of thousands of pounds , which work together to make your flight sa@@ fer . &apos; don &apos;t you make that more confi@@ dent ? &quot; </s>
we know that a design process is not opti@@ mal if it &apos;s too complicated . </s>
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers , for a process , which is very different from classi@@ cal engineering . </s>
it allows us to produce things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce . </s>
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities of that yet . </s>
so , in some sense , the technology gives us the technology . </s>
we use these programs to make the computer much faster , so that we &apos;re able to run these processes even faster . </s>
so , there &apos;s a feedback . </s>
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so conf@@ using . </s>
because all these new technologies of themselves are feeding themselves . </s>
we &apos;re getting down . </s>
we &apos;re at a point , which is the analo@@ g organisms , where cell organisms have evolved to multi-@@ cell organisms . </s>
so we are the amo@@ e@@ ps , and we can &apos;t quite see what the hell we &apos;re going to be creating here . </s>
we &apos;re in the middle of this ent@@ r@@ ance . </s>
but i really believe that something is going to happen to us . </s>
i find it very hard to tell us that we are the final product of evolution . </s>
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of what &apos;s going to happen next . </s>
well , lunch is going to be before , and i think i &apos;m going to stop there before i go . </s>
my story starts right here in ra@@ jas@@ than , about two years ago . </s>
i was under the star sky in the desert with su@@ fi sing@@ er mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar ali . </s>
we talked about nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian e@@ po@@ s &quot; ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot; </s>
if we wanted to travel at the time , we jum@@ ped into a car and s@@ lam@@ med across the sky . </s>
now we &apos;re doing it on air@@ planes . </s>
at the time , when the great indian war prin@@ ri@@ prin@@ z ar@@ jun@@ a had thir@@ st , he took a bow , shot , shot in the soil and water . </s>
now we &apos;re doing this with drill and machines . </s>
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were re@@ placed by machines . </s>
that made me really sad . </s>
i got some scared of technology . </s>
it made me feel afraid that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sun without the camera and without t@@ we@@ et to my friends . </s>
i found that technology should be able to do magic , not killing . </s>
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little sil@@ ver watch . </s>
this piece of 50 year-old technology became the most ma@@ gical thing for me . </s>
she became a golden access to a world full of pir@@ ates and un@@ happy ships and images in my imagination . </s>
i thought it was like having our fan@@ t@@ asy clo@@ ses and cameras sort of dre@@ aming about it . </s>
they kept us inspired by this . </s>
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use them to make magic rather than killing . </s>
when i started 16 , i started to illu@@ strate books . </s>
when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a device for story@@ telling that rea@@ ders can connect around the world . </s>
it can know how we hold it . </s>
it can know where we are . </s>
they bring pictures and text together , and animation , sound and touch . </s>
the story@@ telling has to do more and more senses . </s>
but what are we doing with that ? </s>
i &apos;m just going to go to k@@ ho@@ ya , an interactive i@@ pad app . </s>
it says , &quot; put your finger on every light . &quot; </s>
and so -- it says , &quot; this box is heard , &quot; i write my name . &quot; </s>
and i &apos;m going to be a character in the book . </s>
and again , a letter goes down for me -- and the i@@ pad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s really been add@@ ressed to me . </s>
the kid in me is really excited about these sorts of things . </s>
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic . </s>
i don &apos;t mean magic and dra@@ gon , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all have as children . </s>
fire@@ flies in a j@@ ar i found quite exciting . </s>
so here &apos;s how you have the i@@ pad ki@@ cking , and the fire@@ flies come out of the fire@@ flies . </s>
and they light the way through the rest of the book . </s>
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can fit in a single mar@@ ble . </s>
and therefore , every book and every world will be a little mar@@ ble , which i &apos;m looking for here is the magic device in the machine . </s>
and this opens up a map . </s>
fan@@ t@@ asy books have always had cards , but these maps were static . </s>
this map grows and glo@@ ws and ser@@ ves the ori@@ entation of the rest of the book . </s>
and it also shows in other forms of the book . </s>
i &apos;m going in here . </s>
and it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is in@@ dis@@ crimin@@ ate but also very ti@@ ghtly ti@@ ck@@ led . </s>
these are the ap@@ sar@@ as . </s>
we all heard about fat and ny@@ mp@@ s , but how many people outside india do know their indian colleagues , the ap@@ sar@@ as ? </s>
the poor ap@@ sar@@ as had caught thousands of years in in@@ dr@@ as cham@@ bers in an old mu@@ ff@@ in book . </s>
and we bring them back in a contemporary story for children . </s>
a story dis@@ played with new issues , such as the environmental crisis . </s>
the theme of environmental crisis , a big problem over the last 10 years , is that kids are sitting in their rooms , in their computers , without going out . </s>
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology . </s>
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a quest . you &apos;ve got to go out and collect with the camera of the ic@@ on of natural objects . </s>
as a child , i had colle@@ ctions of sticks , st@@ ones , du@@ cks and sh@@ ells . </s>
somehow , children don &apos;t do anymore . </s>
the childhood ritual is brought back . you have to go out and tag in a chapter of a chapter of a flower and tag on it . </s>
in another chapter , you have to tag a piece of building mri and tag a piece of building . </s>
and so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put online . </s>
a child in london shows the picture of a fo@@ x and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fo@@ g today . &quot; </s>
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot; </s>
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken . </s>
there are a variety of opportunities to connect the world and the technology and the technology . </s>
in the next book , we &apos;re going to do an interaction where you use the video of the i@@ pa@@ ds , and through aug@@ mented reality , we see an animation of el@@ ders that appear on a plant in front of the house . </s>
at one point , the screen takes off with leaves . </s>
you have to make the sound of the wind , throw it away and read the rest of the book . </s>
we all move to a world where the natural forces of technology can get closer and closer in the magic and technology and technology . </s>
we use the energy of the sun . </s>
we bring our kids and we closer to the natural world , and we bring on the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of our childhood medium . </s>
thank you . </s>
this is really an extraordinary honor to me . </s>
i spend most of my time with people studying prison , prison or death cells . </s>
i spend most of my time with the social we@@ ak@@ ings of social development and places where there is a lot of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness . </s>
being here at ted , seeing and hearing how stimul@@ ating it is , has given me a lot of power . </s>
in the short run here , i &apos;ve been clear : ted has an identity . </s>
you can say things that have influence around the world . </s>
and sometimes when something comes over to ted , it gets a meaning and force that it didn &apos;t have . </s>
i say that because i believe that identity is very important . </s>
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations . </s>
i believe that we have learned that the words of a teacher are important , but that the words of a committed teacher are particularly meaningful . </s>
as a doctor , you can do good things as a great doctor , but you can do more . </s>
and so that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity . </s>
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer . </s>
i learned this from my grandmother . </s>
i was large in a family , a traditional afri@@ can@@ -@@ american house@@ hold that was domin@@ ated by a matri@@ ar@@ ch , and this matri@@ ar@@ ch was my grandmother . </s>
she was a bra@@ ve , strong woman , she had effect . </s>
she had the last word in every family fight . </s>
and it was also the starting point of a lot of argu@@ ing in our family . </s>
she was the daughter of a sla@@ ve family . </s>
their parents were born in virginia in the 18@@ 4@@ 0s as sla@@ ves . </s>
she was born in 18@@ 80 , and the experience of sla@@ very shaped her world very strong . </s>
my grandmother was strong , but she was also lo@@ ving . </s>
when i met her as a young boy , she came up to me and she hu@@ gged me . </s>
she pus@@ hed me so hard that i could barely breathe , and then she let me go . </s>
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; br@@ yan , do you feel my hu@@ g ? &quot; </s>
and when i said no , they hu@@ gged me again . if i said yes , she left me alone . </s>
it was something that made you want to be close to it . </s>
the only problem was that she had 10 children . </s>
my mother was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 children . </s>
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was difficult to get your attention . </s>
my cous@@ ins walked around everywhere . </s>
i remember , i must have been eight or nine , that i wo@@ ke up one morning and went into the living room , all my cous@@ ins walked around . </s>
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room , and i was star@@ ing at me . </s>
at first i thought this was a game . </s>
i looked at her and s@@ mil@@ ed , but she looked very serious . </s>
this went on for 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up and she came over to me . she took me to the hand , and she said , &quot; come , br@@ yan . you and i need to talk . &quot; </s>
i still remember it as if it was yesterday . </s>
i will never forget it . </s>
she took me outside , and she said , &quot; br@@ yan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise it . &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; promis@@ es , grandmother . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; honest@@ y ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot; </s>
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; i believe you can do anything you want to do . &quot; </s>
i will never forget that . </s>
and then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things , br@@ yan . &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m told you will always love your mom . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise that you &apos;re always going to care for them . &quot; </s>
i ad@@ just my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot; </s>
and then she said , &quot; well , next , you know , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot; </s>
i thought about , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise . &quot; </s>
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise to me is &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink al@@ co@@ hol . &quot; </s>
now , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot; </s>
i grew up in the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older one and a year younger sister . </s>
when i was about 14 or 15 , my brother came home one day and brought this six-@@ pack beer with my sister and i went and went to the forest with us . </s>
we just regre@@ ted around there as well as anything else . </s>
and then he took a s@@ lot of beer and offered my sister &apos;s sister , and she took her , and then she ban@@ ned me . </s>
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . all right . just do it . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot; </s>
my brother said , &quot; well let &apos;s do that . now we &apos;re going , you know , you &apos;re going to do anything we do . </s>
i had what your sister had . go , drink a beer . &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . just do it . just do it . &quot; </s>
my brother started star@@ ing at me . </s>
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? now drink something . &quot; </s>
and then he looked at me in the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not going to be crazy about the conversation with grand@@ ma ? &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot; </s>
he said , &quot; grand@@ ma tells all of the grand@@ children that they &apos;re special . &quot; </s>
i was deva@@ st@@ ated . </s>
i &apos;m going to give you something . </s>
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that . </s>
this may be transmit@@ ted publi@@ c@@ ly . </s>
i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old and i realized that i &apos;ve never dr@@ unk a drop of al@@ co@@ hol . </s>
i &apos;m not saying this because i believe it &apos;s virtu@@ ous . i &apos;m saying that because identity means identity . </s>
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us that they don &apos;t believe at first . </s>
we can get them to do things that they thought could not be . </s>
of course , my grandmother would say all of their grand@@ children , they &apos;re something special . </s>
my grandfather was in prison during the pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion of prison . </s>
my un@@ cle died of al@@ co@@ hol diseases . </s>
and they believed that these were the issues that we were going to take care of . </s>
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our justice system . </s>
this country is different than 40 years ago . </s>
in 197@@ 2 , 30@@ 0,000 people were in reti@@ rement and in prison . </s>
today , it &apos;s 2.@@ 3 million . </s>
the united states today has the highest in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation of the world . </s>
seven million people are un@@ able to currency , or with a condi@@ tional pun@@ ish@@ ment . </s>
in my opinion , mass in@@ genu@@ ity has fundamentally changed our world . </s>
social weak and black share of the population are des@@ pair and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , because of those changes . </s>
one out of three male black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , on be@@ half of currency , or with condi@@ tional pun@@ ish@@ ment . </s>
in the urban communities around the country -- from los angeles to phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black young men are either in prison , in prison , in prison , or with condi@@ tional pun@@ ish@@ ment . </s>
but our system is not only shaped by questions that have to do with race , it &apos;s also being created by poverty . </s>
we have a justice system in this country that they treat much better when they &apos;re rich and guil@@ ty as poor and inno@@ cent . </s>
wealth , not debt , affect the outcome . </s>
yet , we seem to be happy with this . </s>
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems . </s>
we &apos;ve lost the contact . </s>
i think that &apos;s interesting . </s>
and there are some very interesting develop@@ ments . </s>
my home state of al@@ ab@@ ama ref@@ ers to the vote when they &apos;re being sent@@ enced , if you will . </s>
here and today in al@@ ab@@ ama , 34 percent of male black people have lost their vote perman@@ ently . </s>
we predict that in 10 years , the rate of de@@ for@@ est@@ ation of ci@@ vic honest rights will be as high before the election of the election law . </s>
the silence is ear@@ n pra@@ yer . </s>
i teach kids . </s>
a lot of my cli@@ ents are very young . </s>
the united states of america is the only country in the world that sent@@ enced three year-old children to death in prison . </s>
in this country , for children , there are kids of life without condi@@ tional pun@@ ish@@ ment . </s>
we &apos;ve run a lot of technology . </s>
the only country in the world . </s>
i represent people in death row . </s>
the question of death pen@@ alty is an interesting question . </s>
we think , because we &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : has a human being deser@@ ved to die for a crime crime ? </s>
it &apos;s a very sensi@@ ble question . </s>
but you can also think about it differently depending on how we see our identity . </s>
the other view is not : someone deser@@ ves a crime for death , but , do we deser@@ ve to kill it ? </s>
i find that fascinating . </s>
the death pen@@ alty in america is defined by error . </s>
on nine people that we have execu@@ ted , one that we &apos;ve been con@@ fron@@ ted for inno@@ cent , who has been ki@@ cked out and ki@@ cked out of death row . </s>
an amazing error rate , one of nine inno@@ cent . </s>
i find that fascinating . </s>
we &apos;d never let anyone fly with an airplane if for nine planes , if for nine planes , they pick up , they fall off . </s>
but somehow we &apos;re able to turn away from that problem . </s>
it &apos;s not our problem . </s>
it &apos;s not our bur@@ den . </s>
it &apos;s not our struggle . </s>
i talk a lot about those questions . </s>
i talk about race and the question , whether we &apos;re going to kill the right thing . </s>
and it &apos;s exciting because i teach my students afri@@ can@@ -@@ american history . i talk about sla@@ very . </s>
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the end of the re@@ construction , until the beginning of the second world war . </s>
we don &apos;t really know a lot about this . </s>
but for the afri@@ can@@ -@@ american in this country , it was a time of terror . </s>
in many areas , people had to have fear of ly@@ n@@ ch@@ mo@@ bs . </s>
or bom@@ bs . </s>
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life . </s>
these older people come up to me and say , &quot; m@@ r , ste@@ ven@@ son , they talk , they &apos;re lec@@ tured . they tell the people that they should stop saying that for the first time in the history of our nation with terrorism , after 9 / 11 . &quot; </s>
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with this . &quot; </s>
and after terrorism , of course , the race and decades of ra@@ pid motiv@@ ated sur@@ ren@@ der and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d came and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d . </s>
and yet , in our country , there is a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems . </s>
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history . </s>
and that &apos;s not why we really don &apos;t understand what our actions are in the histor@@ ic context . </s>
we &apos;re constantly bu@@ mp@@ ing up . </s>
we &apos;re always making new ten@@ sions and conflict . </s>
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i believe that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ation . </s>
in south africa , people have understood that the race does not have to be overcome without the will@@ ing@@ ness to truth and recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ation . </s>
even after the geno@@ cide in rwanda , there was this will@@ ing@@ ness , but not in this country . </s>
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death pen@@ alty . </s>
and it was fascinating , because one of the scientists came up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply distur@@ bing , it &apos;s deeply distur@@ bing to hear you talk about it . &quot; </s>
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death pen@@ alty . </s>
and of course , you can &apos;t give them more in germany . &quot; </s>
there was a silence . then a woman said , &quot; well , with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we can ever talk back to the syste@@ matic killing of people . </s>
it would be conf@@ used by us , consciously and tar@@ ge@@ ted people . &quot; </s>
i was thinking about it . </s>
how it would feel worth living in a world where the german state of german people were doing , especially if they were dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately a lot of je@@ ws . </s>
it would be in@@ toler@@ able . </s>
it would be ou@@ trage@@ ous . </s>
and yet , here in this country , in the state of the old south , we &apos;re looking at people -- here &apos;s the risk of being con@@ vi@@ cted to death , 11 times higher when the vic@@ tim is white , as if it &apos;s black . 22 times higher when the black is black and the vic@@ tim is white -- in the same state , the bodies , the bodies , in their soil , are ro@@ cking the body . </s>
and yet , there is this mental dis@@ connect . </s>
i think our identity is threat@@ ened . </s>
if we don &apos;t deal with it , with these difficult top@@ ics , the positive and wonderful things are also affected . </s>
we love innovation . </s>
we love technology and creativity . </s>
we love entertainment . </s>
but ultimately , these reali@@ ties will be ob@@ so@@ le@@ te of suffering , abuse , dis@@ per@@ sal , sett@@ le@@ ment . </s>
i think it &apos;s important to uni@@ te both . </s>
because we ultimately talk about the fact that we need more hope , more engagement , more dedi@@ cation to ins@@ ist in a complex world . </s>
for me , time means bringing up and talking about the poor , the dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ged , the ones that never will be at ted . </s>
but think of a way that is integrated in our own lives . </s>
we all have to believe , ultimately , things that we can &apos;t see . </s>
we do that . as rational as we are , as much as we value intelle@@ ct . </s>
innovation , creativity , and development doesn &apos;t just come from our minds . </s>
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts . </s>
it &apos;s this head@@ -@@ heart connection that i believe that it will drive us , not just to be open to all the bright and en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed things , but for the dark and the proble@@ matic . </s>
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the great c@@ ze@@ ish politi@@ cian , once said . </s>
&quot; when we f@@ ought in eastern europe against the op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed was hope , a mental ori@@ entation , the will@@ ing@@ ness to be sometimes to be hop@@ eless and witness to be witness . &quot; </s>
so this mental ori@@ entation is the core of what i believe that ted communities have to engage in . </s>
there is no boundar@@ y to technology and design that allows us to be fully human and to be human as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty and in@@ justice and in@@ justice . </s>
i want to war@@ n you , this kind of identity requires a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t care about it . </s>
she &apos;s going to touch her deeply . </s>
as a young lawyer , i had the great privilege of meeting pink parks . </s>
again , woman came back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery , where they tra@@ cked two of their oldest friends , these older women , john@@ s car@@ r , who had organized the mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ er@@ y-@@ bus bus boy@@ friend -- an incredible afri@@ can@@ -@@ american -- and virginia dur@@ r , a white husband whose husband , cli@@ ff@@ ord dur@@ r , dr. king represented . </s>
so these women met , and they were just moving . </s>
occasi@@ onally , m@@ r car@@ r then called me and said , &quot; br@@ yan , m@@ yan parks come into the city . we want to talk to us . </s>
do you want to get there and listen ? &quot; </s>
and i said , &quot; yes , very happy . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot; </s>
and i went over and i just heard about it . </s>
it was always so inspiring , it was so po@@ tent . </s>
and one day i was sitting there listening to these women , and after a few hours , mother parks turned to me and said , &quot; well , br@@ yan , tell me what the same initiative is . </s>
what are they trying to do ? &quot; </s>
so i started with my usual talk . </s>
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to deal with in@@ justice . </s>
w@@ r wants to help people who have been con@@ vi@@ cted inno@@ cent . </s>
we want to fight bias and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the crimin@@ al justice system . </s>
we want to make li@@ fel@@ ong ha@@ ir@@ sty@@ les without condi@@ tioning pun@@ ish@@ ment for children . </s>
we want to do something about the death pen@@ alty company . </s>
we want to reduce the number of cro@@ ps . </s>
we want to create mass in@@ comes . &quot; </s>
and i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; hu@@ h . m@@ hmm . m@@ hmm . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you very , very tired . &quot; </s>
and then woman car@@ r car@@ r , he put a finger on my face , and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you have to be very , very ta@@ sti@@ er . &quot; </s>
and so i believe that the ted community should be bra@@ ve . </s>
we need to fin@@ alize ways to address these challenges : these problems , this suffering . </s>
because ultimately our humanity , of course , depends on our humanity . </s>
in my work , i learned very simple things . </s>
i learned a couple of simple things . </s>
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done . </s>
i think that &apos;s true for every human on the planet . </s>
when someone lie , it &apos;s not just a li@@ ar . </s>
when someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear it , it &apos;s not just a th@@ or@@ b . </s>
even who kill@@ s somebody , is not just a killer killer . </s>
and because this is true , there is a fundamental human dignity that needs to respect the law . </s>
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth . </s>
i don &apos;t believe that . </s>
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice . </s>
and finally , i believe that even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring and so reas@@ onable , we &apos;re not measured in the end of our technology , not the things that we &apos;re developing , not our intelle@@ ct and mind . </s>
and finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privi@@ le@@ ged , but how they en@@ counter@@ ed the poor , the con@@ vi@@ cted , the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated . </s>
because in this context we &apos;re beginning to understand the truly amazing things that make us think . </s>
sometimes i lose the balance . one story at the end of the day . </s>
sometimes i ur@@ ge too much . </s>
i &apos;m tired of how we all get . </s>
sometimes these ideas ahead of us predi@@ cts , in a very important way . </s>
i represent these kids who were con@@ vi@@ cted of very hard pun@@ ish@@ ments . </s>
i go to the research prison and i visit a cli@@ ent who may be 13 or 14 years old , and that should be as an adult court . </s>
and then i ask myself , how could this happen ? </s>
how can a judge turn someone into something that he &apos;s not ? </s>
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child . </s>
one night , i stayed too long and thought , oh my god , if a judge could turn us into something else , he must have magic forces . </s>
right , br@@ yan , the judge has magic forces . </s>
you should also want the wish . </s>
and because it was late , and i didn &apos;t really think anymore , i started working on a post . </s>
i had a 14@@ -year-old , poor black boys as a cli@@ ent . </s>
and i started with this contract . the head@@ line said , &quot; yi@@ eld , my poor , 14 , black cli@@ vers like a privi@@ le@@ ged , white , 7@@ 5@@ -year-old top manager to treat . &quot; </s>
in my contract , i explained that mis@@ behavior of the state of the state of state and the police error would be considered to be considered . </s>
there was a crazy thing about this , that in this country there &apos;s nothing more , that there &apos;s only error behavior in this country . </s>
the next morning , i wo@@ ke up and i didn &apos;t know if i &apos;d dre@@ amed of this crazy thing or actually written it . </s>
and to me , i had not only written him , but i was sent to court as well . </s>
a couple of months went on , and i had all for@@ gotten . </s>
but finally , i decided , my god , i &apos;ve got to go to the court and this crazy case . </s>
i went to the car , and i was really overwhel@@ med -- overwhel@@ med . </s>
so i went to the court . </s>
and i thought that was so difficult , so painful . </s>
finally , i got out of my car , and i went up to the court . </s>
when i took the sta@@ ir@@ case to the court , there was an el@@ derly black man , the jan@@ it@@ ors in the court . </s>
when he saw me , he came up to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot; </s>
he came up to me and he hu@@ gged me . </s>
and then he whis@@ ked me into the ear . </s>
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of her . &quot; </s>
and i have to say , there was power . </s>
it tou@@ ches something very deeply within me , identity , the ability to contribute every single one to a community , to a perspective of hope . </s>
now , i walked into the cour@@ ty@@ ard . </s>
once the judge saw me . </s>
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you ask this crazy post ? &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to argue . </s>
and more and more people came in , just because they were angry . </s>
that i had written these crazy things . </s>
police offic@@ ers were coming in and pro@@ ving stat@@ e-@@ gra@@ ders and off@@ ices . </s>
in the trade , the cour@@ thou@@ se was full of people who were angry , that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about ine@@ quality . </s>
from my an@@ gles , i saw the jan@@ it@@ ors going up and down . </s>
he kept seeing through the window , and he could hear the whole to@@ hu@@ w@@ abo@@ h@@ o . </s>
he went up and down . </s>
finally , this older black man came along with a very concerned facial re@@ vel@@ ation in the cour@@ ty@@ ard , and sat right behind me , almost to the defense bank . </s>
10 minutes later , the judge announced a break . </s>
during the break , a police offic@@ er came in , bo@@ ther@@ ed that the jan@@ it@@ ors were in the cour@@ ty@@ ard . </s>
this de@@ pu@@ ty ran over to the older black black . </s>
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what are they doing in the cour@@ ty@@ ard ? &quot; </s>
the older black man stood up . he looked at the de@@ pu@@ ty , and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come here to tell this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal from the eyes . don &apos;t give them up . &quot; </s>
i came to ted , because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral pen@@ dul@@ um of the universe is far away , but that it increases justice . </s>
that we &apos;re not fully designed as human beings unless we care about human rights and basic values . </s>
that all of our survival with the survival of each individual is linked to survival . </s>
that we have to connect our visi@@ ons of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice . </s>
and most of all , i want to see those of you who are also looking at this , just saying , don &apos;t lose the target from your eyes . don &apos;t give up . </s>
you have seen in this audience , this community , an obvious wish to help them and do something . </s>
what else can we do about this ? </s>
br@@ yan ste@@ ven@@ son : well , there are opportunities everywhere . </s>
if you &apos;re living in california , there &apos;s a policy in this spring , where it &apos;s actually an effort to actually do an effort to run something from the money that else flows into the pun@@ ish@@ ment . </s>
here in california , for example , in the next five years , you &apos;re going to run a billion dollars &apos; worth of death for the next five years , one billion dollars . </s>
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all deaths didn &apos;t end up with ar@@ ou@@ sal . </s>
5@@ 6 percent of all ra@@ pes are not going to court . </s>
there is a chance to do something . </s>
this is a reference to suggest that money will invest in more security forces and security . </s>
i think there are opportunities everywhere . </s>
over the last three decades , the crime rate in america has dec@@ lined enor@@ m@@ ously in america . </s>
that fact is often taken into a context with the elev@@ ated in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation numbers . </s>
what would you say to somebody who belie@@ ves this ? </s>
well , in fact , the number of non-@@ violent cri@@ mes hasn &apos;t changed very much . </s>
most of the mass in@@ habit@@ ants in this country found not really in the class of violent cri@@ mes . </s>
it was the mis@@ gui@@ ded cru@@ de of drugs . </s>
and that &apos;s why the dramatic numbers come from the prison houses . </s>
we &apos;ve made ourselves bi@@ ased from the rhe@@ tor@@ ic of the pun@@ ish@@ ment . </s>
now we have &quot; three ver@@ sions &quot; laws that get people forever behind bars , for a bike the@@ ft , to the the@@ ft for the the@@ ft , rather than giving them the things that give back the sacrifi@@ ces . </s>
i think we need to do more to help people become the victims of a crimin@@ al , not less . </s>
and i don &apos;t think our current fun@@ er@@ al philosophy helps anybody to do that . </s>
i think that &apos;s what we need to change . </s>
br@@ yan , they really brought a string to the be@@ ach@@ es here . </s>
they are an inspi@@ rational personality . </s>
thank you for having me at ted . thank you very much . </s>

rec@@ ession . stand still . do@@ om@@ s@@ day . egypt . sy@@ ria . </s>
crisis . death . disaster . </s>
oh my god . </s>
so these are just a few of the cli@@ ps that i &apos;ve been collecting over the last six months -- but it would have been the last six days , or the last six years . </s>
in fact , the media pre@@ v@@ ents us to show us negative issues , because our minds are paying attention to these top@@ ics . </s>
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this too . </s>
every second of the day , our senses begin to process much more information than our brains can ever process . </s>
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first stop for all of this information is part of our tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be , the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala . </s>
so the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early war@@ ning system , our tissue dete@@ ctor . </s>
it en@@ ables and per@@ pe@@ tr@@ ates the whole information to find any sugge@@ stion of any danger in our surro@@ und@@ ings in the world . </s>
so when we see the news , we prefer to look at negative news . </s>
and the old ada@@ ge , when it co@@ vers , the demand goes up very true . </s>
now , with all our digital devices that are seven days a week , 24 hours a day , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic . </s>
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is going to be worse . </s>
but maybe this isn &apos;t the case . </s>
maybe that &apos;s the reality . </s>
perhaps the tremendous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces , is so strong that in the next three decades , it will be possible to create a world of abund@@ ance . </s>
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , bio@@ crisis , water and energy problems -- we &apos;ve already got that . </s>
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at looking at problems in a very long way , but they ultimately overcome . </s>
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century so we can for@@ es@@ e@@ e this . </s>
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has been more than dou@@ bled to the inf@@ lation of inf@@ lation of the population in the world has tri@@ pled . </s>
child mortality has dec@@ lined by a tent@@ h . </s>
what happens is that food , electricity , transportation and communication costs have decre@@ ased a lot of the time . </s>
steve pin@@ ker showed us that we live in a very peac@@ eful time of human history . </s>
and according to charles ken@@ ny , the liter@@ acy rate in the last 130 years is from 25 percent to 80 percent . </s>
we live in a really extraordinary time . </s>
and a lot of people forget this . </s>
and we raise our expectations more and more . </s>
in fact , we &apos;ve re@@ defined poverty . </s>
consider that a large fra@@ ction of americans living under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toi@@ lets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , television , mobile phones , air condi@@ tioning and cars . </s>
the rich@@ est capit@@ alists in the last century , the im@@ per@@ ators of the earth , could never have dre@@ amed of lux@@ ury goods like this . </s>
the foundation for a lot of this is based on technologies , and these are growing exponenti@@ ally . </s>
my good friend ray kurz@@ weil showed us that every tool that &apos;s going to be information technology on the curve , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , is dou@@ bling and dou@@ bling every 12 to 24 months . </s>
that &apos;s why the mobile phone in your pocket costs about a million times less and a thousand times faster than a super@@ computer from the &apos; 70s . </s>
now look at this curve . </s>
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years . </s>
notice two things about this curve . </s>
first of all , how long it goes -- in good times , like bad times , war or peace , rec@@ ession , depression and high history . </s>
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers . </s>
it slo@@ ws down to none of our big problems . </s>
and also , despite their log@@ arith@@ mic lost on the left-@@ hand side , it &apos;s up@@ ward . </s>
so the growth rate itself acceler@@ ates . </s>
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everyone . </s>
&quot; clou@@ d-@@ computing , &quot; something that my friends at auto@@ desk call infin@@ ity computing , sensors and networks , robots , 3d pr@@ inter@@ s that allow personal production to democra@@ ti@@ ze our planet , synthetic biology , fuels , vaccin@@ es and food , digital medicine , nan@@ o-@@ materials and artificial intelligence . </s>
how many of you have seen the vic@@ tory of ibm super@@ computers wat@@ son &apos;s vic@@ tim ? </s>
that was gran@@ di@@ os . </s>
i went through the new@@ spa@@ pers and looked at the best head@@ lines i could find . </s>
i love this one , &quot; wat@@ son e@@ ats human op@@ pon@@ ents . &quot; </s>
risk is not a simple game . </s>
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ ances of language . </s>
imagine that this artificial intelligence gives every ow@@ ner of a mobile phone to make it available . </s>
four years ago , ray kurz@@ weil and i started at ted at ted , which is a new university called sing@@ ul@@ arity university . </s>
we bring our students to all these technologies , with a particular focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity . </s>
and every year , we ask the students to create companies , products and services , which , in a decade , can flow the lives of billions of people . </s>
remember , a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people . </s>
thir@@ ty years ago , that would have been ridiculous . </s>
today we can ver@@ i@@ fy do@@ zens of companies that have done exactly this . </s>
when i think of creating abund@@ ance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of lux@@ ury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about making a life full of opportunities . </s>
it &apos;s about making abund@@ ance from scar@@ ce goods . </s>
scar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ tual , and technology is a resource of liber@@ ating force . </s>
here &apos;s an example . </s>
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ ii in the middle of the 18@@ th century . </s>
he &apos;s the guy on the left . </s>
he invited the king of si@@ am to dinner . </s>
na@@ po@@ le@@ on &apos;s soldiers were getting sil@@ ver bri@@ cks , na@@ po@@ le@@ on did get gold bri@@ ste@@ ck . </s>
the king of si@@ am was al@@ umin@@ um bri@@ ste@@ ck bri@@ ck@@ sha@@ ck . </s>
al@@ umin@@ um was at this time the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and pla@@ in . </s>
this is why the dome in the washington mon@@ um@@ ent was made out of al@@ umin@@ um . </s>
even though al@@ umin@@ um takes 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the mass of the earth , it doesn &apos;t come as pure metal . </s>
it &apos;s connected to oxygen and silicon . </s>
but then the technology of the electro@@ ly@@ te developed and made al@@ umin@@ um so cheap , that we use it with our dis@@ pos@@ able ment@@ ality . </s>
and then let &apos;s project this analog@@ y into the future . </s>
we &apos;re thinking of energy scar@@ city today . </s>
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that is filled with 5@@ ,@@ 000-@@ times more energy than we use every year . </s>
16 ter@@ a@@ watts energy pr@@ ou@@ ls every 8@@ 8 minutes into the surface of the earth . </s>
this is not about scar@@ city , the problem is accessible . </s>
and there &apos;s good news . </s>
this year , for the first time , you have been able to reduce the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the planet electricity -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es in compar@@ ison to 17 ru@@ pe@@ es . </s>
the cost of solar energy fell by 50 percent in the last year year . </s>
last month , this published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade , solar energy is six cents six cents per k@@ w@@ h , compared to 15 cents on the national average . </s>
and if we have an energy sur@@ plus , then we &apos;ll have water in abund@@ ance . </s>
let &apos;s talk about water wars . </s>
do you remember when carl sa@@ gan was the voy@@ a@@ gers of spac@@ a@@ gan when it was moved by saturn , turned back towards earth ? </s>
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ? </s>
&quot; a p@@ ale blue dot . &quot; </s>
because we live on a water planet . </s>
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered in 70 percent with water . </s>
yes , it &apos;s 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent sal@@ t@@ water , two percent are stun@@ ned , and we &apos;re fighting about 0.@@ 5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope . </s>
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now . </s>
they &apos;re new nanot@@ echn@@ ology on the way , nan@@ o-@@ materials . </s>
and from a conversation this morning with dean ka@@ man , one of the innov@@ ators of the do it , i want to share with you something -- he gave me the per@@ mission -- his technical energy , the &quot; sl@@ ing@@ shot , &quot; and many of you may have heard . it &apos;s the size of a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator in the student home . </s>
it can make a thousand gall@@ ons of clean drinking water a day from different sources -- whether sal@@ ty water , pollu@@ ted water , lat@@ r@@ ine -- and all that for less than two cents a gall@@ on . </s>
the cha@@ ir@@ man of coca@@ -@@ cola has actually agreed to launch a large test project with a hundred units in the developing world . </s>
and if everything goes well , i &apos;m very confi@@ dent , then coca@@ -@@ cola will apply this technology globally in 20@@ 6 countries around the planet . </s>
this is technology &apos;s suppor@@ tive innovation that we have today . </s>
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones . </s>
you know my goo@@ dness , we &apos;re getting 70 percent reduction of mobile phones in developing countries in the developing world , until the end of 20@@ 13 . </s>
consider that a ma@@ sa@@ i war@@ ri@@ or with a cell phone in the center of kenya has a better mobile communications than president re@@ ag@@ an 25 years ago . </s>
and if you &apos;re looking for your smart@@ phone on google , you &apos;ve got more access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago . </s>
they live in a world that has information and communication in the abund@@ ance as no one could have ever predi@@ cted . </s>
and it gets better , the things that you and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , h@@ d video and photo , libr@@ aries full of books and music , technology to medical diagno@@ sis -- are literally being ki@@ cked out and cheaper in your cell phone . </s>
and the best part of this is maybe what &apos;s expected to do in health care . </s>
in the last month i had the pleasure , with the qual@@ it@@ or foundation , called the &quot; $ 10 million quality tri@@ cor@@ m tri@@ cor@@ der tri@@ cor@@ der prize prize . &quot; </s>
we ask teams all over the world to connect all these technologies into a mobile phone so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equi@@ pped with ai , you can test rein@@ v@@ ents or your bloo@@ d@@ lines . </s>
and to win , the device needs to be a better diagno@@ sis than a team of highly quali@@ fied doctors . </s>
imagine this device -- in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease bur@@ den and 1.@@ 3 percent of the staff of health care . </s>
if this device sequen@@ ced a r@@ ent or dna virus that is not known , it calls the health care board and pre@@ v@@ ents a pande@@ mic from their out@@ break . </s>
but now the biggest force that is going to lead us to a world of abund@@ ance . </s>
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot; </s>
the white lines are the population . </s>
we &apos;ve just cros@@ sed the 7@@ -@@ billi@@ on-@@ dollar brand . </s>
and just by the way , the biggest decline against a population explosion is a better education and food in the world . </s>
in 2010 , we had just connected under two billion people online . </s>
by 20@@ 20 , we go from two billion to five billion internet users . </s>
three billion new heads we &apos;ve never heard before will join global communication . </s>
what do these people need ? </s>
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to desire ? </s>
and instead of economic still , i see one of the greatest economic sh@@ out in history . </s>
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow into the global economy . </s>
and they &apos;re going to be heal@@ thi@@ er by the use of the tri@@ co@@ e , and they &apos;re getting better trained by the k@@ han academy , and they &apos;re going to have the opportunity to use 3d pr@@ inter@@ s , 3d pr@@ inter@@ s and computing , and be so much more productive than ever . </s>
so what can be three billion , healthy , educated , productive , productive members of the human community ? </s>
how about a sentence of new , never before audi@@ ences . </s>
how about the op@@ pres@@ sed wherever they are , wherever they are , to give a voice to pay attention to and create change for the first time ? </s>
what are these three billion people going to bring together ? </s>
how about ta@@ stes that we can &apos;t even predict ? </s>
one of the things that i &apos;ve learned from the x prize is that small teams who are motiv@@ ated by passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that large companies and governments have been able to do in the past . </s>
i want to close with a story that really exc@@ ites me . </s>
there &apos;s a program that might already be familiar with this . </s>
it &apos;s a game called fol@@ dit . </s>
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle . </s>
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds to study how the protein is going to evolve . </s>
depending on its behavior , we can predict the structure and function . </s>
and this is very important in medical research . </s>
so far , this has been a super@@ computer problem . </s>
and this game was played by university profess@@ ors and so on . </s>
and there are now hundreds of thousands of people who have played the game online . </s>
and it showed that today the human pattern recognition better fol@@ ds into proteins than the best super@@ computers . </s>
and when these people came and watched who is the best protein fol@@ der in the world , this was not a mit professor , no cal@@ tech student , it was somebody from england , man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who was working as a assi@@ stant in a re@@ ha@@ -@@ clinic clinic , and at night at night , and the best proteins in the world was working on the world at night . </s>
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that today we have more power than individuals to make the big challenges of our planet . </s>
we have access to tools of exponenti@@ al technology . </s>
we have the passion of a di@@ y innov@@ ator . </s>
we have the capital of tech@@ no-@@ philanthrop@@ y . </s>
and we have three billion new heads that we can work with online to master the new challenges , and to do what is necessary . </s>
we expect a couple of extraordinary decades . </s>
thank you . </s>
i believe that we have something to do with a transforma@@ tive piece of medical culture . </s>
and i think it starts with a medi@@ cin@@ er , and i am . </s>
and maybe i &apos;m long enough in business as that i can allow myself to give up a piece of my own pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce to try and do that . </s>
but before i get to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball . </s>
hey , why not ? </s>
we are close to the seas@@ onal , and we move to the world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship . </s>
we all love baseball , right ? </s>
baseball is full of great statistics . </s>
and there are hundreds of them . </s>
&quot; mon@@ ey@@ ball &quot; seems soon to be statistics , and to use this to use a great baseball team . </s>
i &apos;m going to talk to one of the statistics that i hope most of you have heard of . </s>
it &apos;s the average achie@@ vement of the bat . </s>
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat is be@@ ating . </s>
that means that the players are safe to beat three to 10 in the t@@ win . </s>
this is what the ball is going to hit , and he &apos;s coming up , he &apos;s not caught up , and who &apos;s trying to take the ball into the first base base , and the run@@ ner was in safety . </s>
three out of 10 . </s>
do you know how to call a 3,000 lea@@ f baseball baseball ? </s>
well , really good , maybe an all-@@ star star . </s>
do you know how to call a 4@@ 00@@ ter ? </s>
this is somebody who is probably four out of 10 out of the way . </s>
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- like ted willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- the last major lea@@ gue baseball player who met during a regular season over 400 times . </s>
let &apos;s trans@@ mit ourselves back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot of well-being , or maybe a little bit less comfortable after i talked to you about it . </s>
if you &apos;ve got a blin@@ d@@ fold , you &apos;re trans@@ fer@@ red to an oper@@ ator , the average amount of blin@@ dness in terms of blin@@ dness in terms of blin@@ dness . </s>
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work , right ? </s>
if you took life in a particular remote area , and you have a belo@@ ved people with clo@@ gged heart disease , and your physi@@ cian pro@@ posed that to a car@@ di@@ ologist whose average performance is at 200 times the average performance of 200 . </s>
but , you know what ? </s>
it &apos;s much better this year ; it &apos;s on the rising bran@@ ch . </s>
and she &apos;s making a 25@@ 7 . </s>
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work . </s>
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question . </s>
what do you believe like the average performance for a car@@ di@@ ologist or a nurse or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c director who should be a rescu@@ e assi@@ stant ? </s>
1,000 , very good . </s>
the truth is that no one in all medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor or rescu@@ e should be assi@@ stant to . </s>
what we do is , however , is that every one of you , including each of you , including me in the world to be perfect . </s>
never make a mistake , but no one is going to make sense of the details of how that should be done . </s>
and this is the message i took up in medical school . </s>
i was a com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive obs@@ essi@@ ve student . </s>
high school once told a student that brian gold@@ man said that brian gold@@ man would learn a bloo@@ dy test for a bloo@@ d@@ line . </s>
and it did . </s>
and i learned about my little roof res@@ iden@@ ce in the sisters res@@ iden@@ ce at the tor@@ onto general hospital , not from here . </s>
i learned anything about it . </s>
in my anatom@@ ic lec@@ tures , i learned the orig@@ ins and pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ced every muscle , every single ar@@ tery of every ar@@ tery away from the a@@ or@@ ta , ob@@ sc@@ ure and ordinary differ@@ ential diagno@@ ses . </s>
i knew even the differ@@ enti@@ ated diagno@@ sis of classi@@ fying tu@@ bu@@ ll@@ ine a@@ fi@@ can a@@ fi@@ can . </s>
and i gather@@ ed more and more knowledge all the time . </s>
and i was good , i sat down with c@@ um lau@@ de . </s>
and i left the medical school with the impres@@ sion that i knew everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible , that i &apos;m immune to the making of mistakes . </s>
and it worked for a while until i met her prin@@ ter . </s>
i was resi@@ sted at a school hospital here in tor@@ onto as a woman prin@@ ted to me in the emergency room department of the hospital . </s>
at this point , i was pro@@ ved to be the car@@ di@@ ology layer in the car@@ di@@ ology service . </s>
and it was my mission when the emergency staff car@@ di@@ a@@ c council was looking for the emergency patients to study . </s>
and give feedback to my super@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law . </s>
i studied m@@ ere prin@@ ter , and she was in res@@ pir@@ atory . </s>
and when i listen@@ ed to her , she made obvious sounds . </s>
and when i heard her breast with the ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e , i was able to hear a cra@@ cking sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering from con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure . </s>
this is a condition in which the heart fa@@ ils , instead of pump@@ ing the whole blood , putting a part of the blood in the lung and filling it up and filling it gradu@@ ally , so the shor@@ th@@ and comes back . </s>
and it wasn &apos;t a difficult diagno@@ sis . </s>
i hi@@ red her , and made me the treatment . </s>
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in . i gave her her medicine to take the pressure of the heart . </s>
i gave her medicine that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water tab@@ lets , so they watch the liquid out of the liquid . </s>
and over a year and a half and two hours , they started to feel better . </s>
i felt really good for myself . </s>
and that &apos;s when i got my first mistake ; i sent them home . </s>
actually , i made two mistakes . </s>
i sent them home without speaking to my super@@ doctor . </s>
i didn &apos;t take the audi@@ ences , and i did what i should have , which would have been a phone call to my high doctor to illu@@ strate it , so that he would have had a chance to make a picture . </s>
and he knew he &apos;d be able to contribute more addi@@ tional information to her . </s>
maybe i did it for good reason . </s>
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a doctor &apos;s help doctor . </s>
perhaps i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking the responsibility that i was so negoti@@ ated , and so i would be able to care for my patients without having to contact him . </s>
my second mistake was worse . </s>
and so i sent them home , and i mix@@ ed with a quiet voice in my home trying to tell me , &quot; gold@@ man , don &apos;t do a good idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot; </s>
in fact , it lac@@ ked me so much in confidence that i asked the nurse who took care of women , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot; </s>
and the nurse thought about it , and he said , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go well . &quot; </s>
i remember being like it was yesterday . </s>
so i signed the de@@ ple@@ tion papers and a car assi@@ stant and a rescu@@ e assi@@ stant , and i brought them home . </s>
and i went back to work . </s>
the rest of the day , the night i got this na@@ gging feeling in my sto@@ mach . </s>
but i kept working . </s>
and at the end of the day , i grab@@ bed my thing , i put the hospital down and went to the parking lot for the car , when i was doing something that i didn &apos;t do . </s>
i went home through the emergency room on my way home . </s>
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen a woman prin@@ ter , but another three words to me , and those three words , most of the emergency doctors i know , who i know that i know . </s>
other medi@@ cations fear these as well , but emergency medicine is particularly special because we only see the patients as el@@ abor@@ ate . </s>
the three words read : do you remember ? </s>
&quot; do you remember the patients you sent home ? &quot; </s>
the nurse asked the story . </s>
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in that particular pit@@ ch . </s>
so she was back . </s>
she was back and die . </s>
about an hour after she arrived at home , after i sent her home , she collap@@ sed , and the family called 9@@ 11 . the rescu@@ e assi@@ sts took her back to the emergency room with a blood pressure blood pressure pressure , which is a dangerous shock . </s>
she barely brea@@ th@@ ed and was blue . </s>
the emergency room was wearing all the str@@ ands . </s>
they gave her blood pressure increase . </s>
they shut it down to the machine machine . </s>
i was sho@@ cked and s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed all the way into the body . </s>
and i went through this roll@@ er@@ co@@ aster , because she came to the intensive care unit , and i hop@@ ed it would re@@ cover . </s>
and after two , three days , it was clear that she would never re@@ cover . </s>
she didn &apos;t have a treat@@ able brain damage . </s>
her family got together . </s>
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they gave up the sho@@ wer . </s>
the next day they li@@ fted her -- women prin@@ ter , a woman , a mother and grandmother . </s>
they &apos;re told that they never forget the names of people who never forget . </s>
and this is the first time that i learned this myself . </s>
the next few weeks , i took advantage of myself , and i learned for the first time the un@@ healthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isol@@ ated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it . </s>
you all know the healthy shame when you give a secret to the best friend &apos;s prize , even though that one is in balance and then you get caught and you get caught with it , my best friend , and my best discussion is , when you end up at the end of the day , you &apos;re doing the bad thing , and you swe@@ ar that you never make a mistake like that again . </s>
if you make re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing and never make the mistake ever again . </s>
that &apos;s the kind of educational shame . </s>
the un@@ healthy way that i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you sick . </s>
it &apos;s the one that tells you that what you &apos;re doing is not what you &apos;re doing , but you &apos;re bad . </s>
and that &apos;s what i felt . </s>
and it wasn &apos;t at the point of my head , he was very up@@ set . </s>
he spoke to the family , and i &apos;m sure he smo@@ ked the wo@@ und and made sure i wasn &apos;t going to su@@ ck . </s>
but i kept asking these questions . </s>
why didn &apos;t i ask the chief doctor ? why did i send them home ? </s>
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ? </s>
why did i go to medicine ? </s>
but slowly it turned out . </s>
i started to feel better . </s>
and then on a be@@ ating day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke , and i maybe said , maybe i could feel better again . </s>
and i was acting to myself that if i dou@@ bled my effort to perfe@@ ction , and never again made a mistake that the voice could mu@@ st@@ le . </s>
and she did . </s>
and i kept working . </s>
and then it happened again . </s>
two years later , i had service in the emergency room in a commun@@ al hospital north of tor@@ onto tor@@ onto tor@@ onto from tor@@ onto , and i saw a 25@@ -year-old man with rich ra@@ ces . </s>
it was a lot less , and i was in the hur@@ ry . </s>
he always showed up here . </s>
i looked in the ru@@ b , and it was a little bit pink . </s>
and i gave him a prescri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and sent him away . </s>
and even when he went out of the door , he showed up on his ra@@ il@@ road . </s>
two days later , i came to my next emergency service , and my chief asked me to speak for a conversation with her office . </s>
and she said the three words : do you remember ? </s>
&quot; do you remember ra@@ cing with the patients ? &quot; </s>
it turns out he &apos;s a stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ us infe@@ ction infe@@ ction . </s>
he had a potentially life-@@ threat@@ ening illness called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis . </s>
you can google this , but it &apos;s not an infe@@ ction of the ru@@ b , but the top line , and caused the clo@@ thing of the breathing space . </s>
and lu@@ ck@@ ily , he didn &apos;t die . </s>
he got in@@ tra@@ ven@@ se anti@@ bo@@ 25 , and he re@@ covered a few days later . </s>
and i went back through the same tor@@ ture of shame and self-@@ doubt , liber@@ ating me liber@@ ty and went to work until it came back and over and over again . </s>
in an emergency class , i &apos;ve over@@ looked a blin@@ dness of blin@@ dness . </s>
there &apos;s a lot to be heard about this , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that had only 14 patients a night at that time . </s>
in both cases , i wouldn &apos;t send them home , and there was no man in their treatment either . </s>
at one point i thought he had ki@@ dney st@@ ones . </s>
i took the x-ray of the ki@@ dney . when it was a little bit of a fund , my colleague at the re@@ creation of the patient re@@ designing the lower right sector of the patient , called the oper@@ ator , and called the oper@@ ators . </s>
the other one was very di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a . </s>
i or@@ dered flu@@ i@@ des to re@@ hy@@ dr@@ ating and asked my colleagues to com@@ mit him as well . </s>
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he saw a re@@ mark in the right lower sector , he called the oper@@ ators . </s>
in both cases , surgery got surgery , and they were doing fine . </s>
both of these cases went to me and ask me . </s>
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened in the first five years , which is what many of my colleagues argue is , but total non@@ sense . </s>
some of my so@@ und@@ scap@@ es happened over the last five years . </s>
by the way , shame and without support . </s>
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t finish up with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can tell the quiet voice that tells me what really can &apos;t find , how can i share it with my colleagues ? </s>
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they don &apos;t go the same way ? </s>
if i &apos;m going into a room -- like now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about . </s>
when did the last time you heard about somebody who was talking about mis@@ sions about failure ? </s>
oh yes , you go to a cock@@ tail party and you might hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talk about your own mistakes . </s>
if i would sit in a room with colleagues full of colleagues and ask for their immedi@@ ate support , and tell them what i was telling you , i wouldn &apos;t probably get to the end of the second story before , before it really would be un@@ comfortable , someone would change a joke , they would change the issue and forget about the rest . </s>
and in fact , if i or my colleagues knew that an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c in my hospital had taken off the wrong leg , believe me , i would have trouble looking at him in the eyes . </s>
that is the system that we live in . </s>
it &apos;s a totally den@@ ial of er@@ rors . </s>
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those that make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do -- those who restri@@ ct sleep constra@@ ints and the without limit@@ ations that with bad results and the good results with good results . </s> &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological reaction like anti@@ bodies , such as anti@@ bodies attac@@ king people . </s>
and there is the idea that if we make the ones that make mistakes out of medicine , we will have a safe system . </s>
but there are two problems with this . </s>
in my about 20 years of medical sen@@ ti@@ ent and journ@@ alism , i created a personal medical study about medical error and false treatments to create all of my potential for one of my first articles , which i wrote for the tor@@ onto star to my show &quot; white co@@ at , black art , &quot; wrote to learn . </s>
and what i learned is that mistakes are completely in@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible . </s>
we &apos;re working in a system where every day , where one in 10 medi@@ cations is either a wrong or wrong do@@ main in the hospital infe@@ ctions , in the hospital infe@@ ctions and deva@@ stat@@ ing or deva@@ stat@@ ing or dead . </s>
in this state , it &apos;s about 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans dying in this state . </s>
in the united states , the institute for medicine ad@@ ds the number at 100,000 . </s>
they &apos;re both strong sub@@ mis@@ sions , because we don &apos;t see the problem as much as we should . </s>
and that &apos;s the cru@@ x . </s>
in a hospital system where medical knowledge dou@@ bled every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it . </s>
sleep depri@@ vation is ubi@@ quit@@ ous . </s>
we can &apos;t get rid of it . </s>
we have a cognitive error , so that we can take a perfect path@@ ologi@@ es for a patient with breast pain . </s>
and then i take the same patient with breast pain , make it swe@@ at and swe@@ at and give you a little bit of al@@ co@@ hol in it , and all of a sudden the story is con@@ fin@@ ed with con@@ temp@@ t . </s>
i &apos;m not taking the same trajec@@ tory . </s>
i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not always doing things in the same way . </s>
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms always in the same way . </s>
all this stuff su@@ ms up to be inevi@@ table . </s>
so if you take the system , as i was taught , how i was taught all of the mis@@ si@@ le health workers , no more left at the end of the day . </s>
and do you know the ligh@@ t@@ ning about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ? </s>
in my show , &quot; white co@@ at , black art , &quot; i have the hab@@ it of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to anybody from the rescu@@ e assi@@ stant until the car@@ di@@ ologist saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; what about yours ? &quot; and then i &apos;m going to show the micro@@ phone . </s>
and then their pu@@ p@@ ils expand , they &apos;re in front of the head , they look down , they look down , they look down , and they start to tell their stories . </s>
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories . </s>
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same mistakes i made . &quot; </s>
what they need is an environment that puts them into the situation . </s>
what they need is a new medical culture . </s>
and it starts with a doctor . </s>
the rein@@ defined doctor is a person , white to his humanity , accep@@ ted it &apos;s not proud of making mistakes , but putting all of that out of them so that it can be passed on . </s>
they share their experiences with others . </s>
it suppor@@ ts when others talk about their mistakes . </s>
and she shows others their mistakes , not to ju@@ ice , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way all of them benefit . </s>
and she works in a medical culture that recogni@@ zes that people will fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s true , people also make mistakes from time to time . </s>
so that the system then developed bac@@ ku@@ ps , which makes it easier to make mistakes that make people inevi@@ table , and it allows them to create suppor@@ tive , suppor@@ tive spaces where anyone who can monitor health care can actually address things that are potential mistakes and even re@@ war@@ ded for even people like me who make mistakes and should be re@@ war@@ ded for the gra@@ ti@@ fication of those re@@ wards that should be re@@ war@@ ded . </s> &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
my name is brian gold@@ man . </s>
i &apos;m the rein@@ defined doctor . </s>
i &apos;m a person . i make mistakes . </s>
but i &apos;m di@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to pass it out to others . </s>
i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re holding from me , but i can live with that . </s>
so let me close with three of my own words : i remember . </s>
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea . </s>
it &apos;s about changing standards . </s>
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories before to take advantage of time . </s>
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes . </s>
you know , he was there 18@@ 35 here . </s>
you may think he &apos;s enjo@@ ying fin@@ ishing , but that &apos;s not true . </s>
he actually collected fish fish . </s>
he described one of them as very common . </s>
it was a grou@@ per . </s>
until the &apos; 80s , it was fis@@ hed into great style . </s>
now he &apos;s standing on the red list of en@@ danger@@ ed species . </s>
this is a story we &apos;ve heard many times from the gala@@ pa@@ gos , or from other places , it &apos;s not very special . </s>
yet , we &apos;re still coming to the gala@@ pa@@ gos . </s>
we &apos;re still thinking they &apos;re origin@@ ally . </s>
the bro@@ ther@@ lands still describe them as un@@ touched . </s>
now , what has happened here ? </s>
the second story is supposed to be a different concept , which is changing , illu@@ strated , illu@@ strated . </s>
because i experienced it when i studied a la@@ go@@ on in west africa in 197@@ 1 . </s>
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work later in africa . </s>
i thought i could integra@@ te myself . </s>
and i got a bad sun@@ burn , and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t get from there . </s>
it was my first sun@@ burn . </s>
as you can see , the la@@ go@@ on was surrounded by pal@@ ms and some man@@ gro@@ ves . </s>
there were about 20 centi@@ meter bar@@ rel@@ s of black , black h@@ ills , a sub@@ si@@ dy sub@@ scri@@ ption . </s>
the fish causes of these bun@@ ks were very productive , and the fisher@@ men lived good for them and deser@@ ved in ghana well in ghana . </s>
when i returned there 27 years later , the fish was shr@@ in@@ king to half of its size . </s>
they grow up five centi@@ meters . </s>
they were gene@@ tically engine@@ ered . </s>
it was still fish . </s>
people were still happy . </s>
and the fish was also lucky to be there . </s>
so it didn &apos;t change anything , and yet everything changed . </s>
my third little story told about my participa@@ tion in the introdu@@ ction of dra@@ iling fisher@@ y fisher@@ ies in sou@@ the@@ ast asia . </s>
in the 197@@ 0s -- more at the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- europe pro@@ posed a lot of development projects . </s>
fis@@ sion meant countries that started 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing of this kind of ugly ship is called mu@@ ti@@ ara 4 . </s>
and i went on that , and we made consider@@ ation in the entire southern southern china , and particularly in the ja@@ vas@@ e@@ e . </s>
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there . </s>
i know now that it was the reason of the ocean . </s>
nin@@ et@@ y percent of our fan@@ s were spon@@ tane@@ ous , other animals that were connected to the ground . </s>
the vast majority of the fish , the little dots there on the rub@@ ble , the stre@@ tch , were coral reef fish fish . </s>
basically , the cause of the ocean was on de@@ ck and was thrown back . </s>
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition is going very fast . </s>
within a year , you get a cen@@ sus and you start with the commercial fisher@@ y . </s>
the reason it &apos;s changed -- in this case -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral is going to be pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ced . </s>
this is a dead tur@@ tle . </s>
they didn &apos;t eat , they thre@@ w them away because they were dead . </s>
once , we began a living life . </s>
she wasn &apos;t dro@@ w@@ ning . </s>
then they wanted to kill them because they were able to eat them well . </s>
in fact , this mountain of rub@@ bers is acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ated every time of fish , when they &apos;re in areas where they &apos;ve never been fish . </s>
but it doesn &apos;t get docum@@ ented . </s>
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it . </s>
we &apos;re ad@@ vis@@ ing our standards of the new level , and not calling us what &apos;s going on there . </s>
when you gener@@ alize it , this is what happens . </s>
on the y-@@ axis , there are some good things : bio@@ diversity , number of or@@ ca , the green of their country , the water supply . </s>
over time , it changes . it changes , because for people , their actions are completely natural . </s>
every generation looks at the images that they take in the beginning of their conscious lives as standard and will deri@@ ve everything from it . </s>
the difference is percei@@ ved as a loss of loss . </s>
but you don &apos;t take the previous los@@ ses . </s>
there can be a sequence of changes . </s>
and at the end of the day , they only want to get the most her@@ itable remains . </s>
so that &apos;s exactly what our goal is . </s>
we want to get things that have disappeared or things that are no longer the way they were . </s>
now , you could think that the problem of people who lived in predat@@ ors certainly killed them in predat@@ or societies , and they only became aware of a few generations after they did what they had done . </s>
because obviously , an animal that has been very frequ@@ ently frequ@@ ent , first of all , before it dies out . </s>
so you don &apos;t quite lose animals very often . </s>
you always lose rare animals . </s>
and therefore it &apos;s not being seen as a big loss of loss . </s>
over time , we &apos;re focusing on the big animals , and in the sea are the big fish . </s>
they become less rare because we start them . </s>
over time , little fish remain left , and we think that &apos;s worth the standard . </s>
the question is why people accept it . </s>
now , because they don &apos;t know it was once different . </s>
of course , many people , scientists , con@@ fir@@ ms that it &apos;s really different . </s>
they will con@@ firm it , because the evidence they do in the previous form is not the way they liked the evidence of the evidence . </s>
for example , there &apos;s the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that the report of a cap@@ tain of cap@@ ability that can be seen in this area cannot be used in this area , or cannot be used by fishing , or fishing scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot; </s>
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past . </s>
that shows the enor@@ m@@ ously large role that can play a marine reser@@ ve . </s>
because through marine reser@@ ves , we basically put back the past . </s>
we provide the past , which people can &apos;t understand because the standards have changed and are very low . </s>
so the people who see a marine san@@ ctu@@ ary and they can benefit from the vie@@ w@@ points that en@@ ables it to re@@ store their standards . </s>
what about the people that aren &apos;t possible because they have no access -- the people in the mid@@ west , for example ? </s>
so here , i think , the art and the film might fill the gap and simu@@ lations . </s>
this is the simulation of ch@@ es@@ ape@@ a@@ ke bay . </s>
a long time ago , there were gray whales -- 500 years ago . </s>
and the color@@ ed sound and the sha@@ do@@ ws might remind you of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot; </s>
when you think of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; when you think about why people were so touched by it -- except for the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ ic story , why were they so touched by the picture world ? </s>
because it wa@@ stes something that has been lost in some way . </s>
so my recom@@ men@@ dation , the only one i &apos;ll give , is on camer@@ on on camer@@ on , so he &apos;s sp@@ inning &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar ii &quot; underwater . </s>
thank you . </s>
in the &apos; 80s , in the commun@@ ist east germany , you had to , if you had a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had to regi@@ ster them in the government . </s>
they also had to regi@@ ster a lea@@ f from the ty@@ pe@@ writer of this ty@@ pe@@ writer . </s>
the reason for this -- the government was able to re@@ tra@@ ce where a text came from . </s>
they found a paper with wrong thought , you could feel the cre@@ ators of these thoughts . </s>
and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west how anyone could do that , and how much that would restri@@ ct freedom of speech . </s>
in our own countries , we would never do that . </s>
but if you buy a new color laser prin@@ ter in 2011 in the year 2011 and print a page , this page has bright yellow spots on every page , in a pattern that clearly puts the page on it and your prin@@ ter back . </s>
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening today . </s>
and nobody seems to have noticed about that . </s>
and this was an example , in which our own governments , our own governments , are using technology for us , the citizens . </s>
and that &apos;s one of the three main sources of the online existing problems today . </s>
let &apos;s see what happens in the world : we can split the attacks into categ@@ ories . </s>
we have three main groups . </s>
there are online criminals . </s>
for instance , this is mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bow from k@@ ie@@ v in u@@ kra@@ ine . </s>
and the mo@@ tives of online criminals are very easy to understand . </s>
these people make money . </s>
they use online attacks to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money . </s>
there are several well-@@ known cases of online million@@ ai@@ re , multi-@@ million@@ ai@@ re that have made their money through attacks . </s>
this is w@@ lo@@ di@@ me t@@ sa@@ st@@ s@@ in from tar@@ tu in est@@ on@@ ia . </s>
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z . </s>
stephen watts . </s>
b@@ j@@ bin@@ n s@@ und@@ in . </s>
this is mat@@ the@@ w anderson , t@@ ari@@ q al-@@ da@@ our and so on and so forth . </s>
these people have come online to wealth , but they &apos;ve illegal illegal by using tro@@ j@@ ans to put money out of our bank accoun@@ ts while we &apos;re doing our online ban@@ king , or also key@@ log@@ gers who &apos;ve collected our credit card information to the keyboard , while we &apos;re buying over a infected computer online . </s>
the u.s. intelligence agency fro@@ sted the s@@ wis@@ s account of mr. ja@@ in sam ja@@ in here , and this account was 14@@ .@@ 9 million u.s. dollars when it was frozen . </s>
mr. ja@@ in himself is on open foot , which is the unknown place , is unknown . </s>
and i want to argue that today it &apos;s more likely that we will become victims of a online crime than a crime in the real world . </s>
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be even worse . </s>
in the future , most of the crime will be played online . </s>
the second largest group that we can see today is not motiv@@ ated by money . </s>
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- prote@@ sts , an opinion , or through their audi@@ ences . </s>
groups like anony@@ mous are up over the last 12 months , and they &apos;ve become one of the main players in the field of online attacks . </s>
so these are the three main tan@@ gible groups : criminals who are doing it for doing ha@@ cking , ha@@ cking like anony@@ mous anony@@ mous , but the last group are nations , governments , governments that lead the attacks . </s>
that &apos;s where we are , as in den@@ in@@ ot@@ ar . </s>
it certainly shows what happens when governments attack their own citizens . </s>
z@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a full cer@@ ti@@ fication of the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or it was that it was . </s>
in the last fall , it had to regi@@ ster in@@ so@@ ven@@ ce , because den@@ in@@ ot@@ ar was ha@@ cked . </s>
someone had broken up , and had cra@@ cked the system very th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly . </s>
and last week in a meeting with du@@ tch government offi@@ ci@@ als , i asked one of the questions of this group , whether he was possible for possible that he had died because of the fun@@ gu@@ s ha@@ ck ha@@ ckers . </s>
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot; </s>
well , how do people die in the after@@ math of such a ha@@ ck ? </s>
den@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ tifi@@ cate . </s>
they sell cer@@ tifi@@ c@@ ates . </s>
what do you do with cer@@ tifi@@ cate ? </s>
well , a cer@@ tifi@@ cate takes if you have a website with h@@ tt@@ ps , with ss@@ le en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted service service , like g@@ mail , for example . </s>
now we all use , or many of us , g@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are particularly common in tot@@ al@@ itarian states such as iran , where they use dis@@ si@@ dents like g@@ mail like g@@ mail , because they know that they can trust more than local provi@@ ders , and that they &apos;re en@@ co@@ ded over ss@@ le connection , so that the local government can &apos;t s@@ wal@@ low around in their talks . </s>
but , you know , when you &apos;re in a foreign out@@ ward . </s>
cer@@ ti@@ fication ha@@ cking ha@@ cking cer@@ e@@ al cer@@ tifi@@ cate . </s>
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar . </s>
how does it compare to the arab spring and the things that have happened in egypt in egypt ? </s>
well , in egypt , the insur@@ gen@@ cy of the insur@@ gen@@ cy in april 2011 was the head@@ quarters of the egyp@@ ti@@ an intelligence police , and they found a lot of action . </s>
in those records , a fol@@ der called &quot; fin@@ fis@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h . &quot; </s>
and in this fol@@ der , a fol@@ ded company in germany , which the egyp@@ ti@@ an government had sold a few programs to the egyp@@ ti@@ an government , which they -- in a very big frame -- could catch any communication of egyp@@ ti@@ an citizens . </s>
they had sold this program for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 dollars to the egyp@@ ti@@ an government . </s>
the head@@ quarters head@@ quarters are right here . </s>
so western governments are providing tot@@ al@@ itarian governments with aid , so they can move against their own citizens . </s>
but western governments also help themselves . </s>
for example , in germany only a few weeks ago the state of the state , this was a tro@@ j@@ an who was used by german government offi@@ ci@@ als to pit@@ ch their own citizens . </s>
if you &apos;re sus@@ pen@@ ded in a crimin@@ al case , pretty much your phone is ta@@ pped by your phone . </s>
but today , we &apos;re far beyond it . </s>
they tap into their internet connection . </s>
they use tools like the state stra@@ yer to play their computer with a tro@@ j@@ an that allows them to monitor their entire communication , listen to their online discus@@ sions , to collect their pas@@ s@@ words . </s>
so when we think about things like this , the obvious answer to people is , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter because i &apos;m a bra@@ ve citi@@ zen . </s>
i don &apos;t have to worry ! </s>
i don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot; </s>
and this argument doesn &apos;t make any sense . </s>
priv@@ acy needs to be there . </s>
priv@@ acy is not about debate . </s>
it &apos;s not a decision between priv@@ acy and safety . </s>
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control . </s>
and today , in 2011 , in the year 2011 , our governments may trust , but every right thing we do is give birth to forever . </s>
and do we trust , do we blind from any future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ? </s>
those are the questions that we need to spend the next 50 years on . </s>
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of concrete block . </s>
the first concrete blocks were made in 18@@ 6@@ 8 , and a simple idea of a simple idea : mo@@ du@@ le cement , which fits together . </s>
concrete building blocks became very quickly the most under@@ utili@@ zed building unit in the world . </s>
they put us in the shoes to build things that were larger than we were , buildings , brid@@ ges , one stone after another . </s>
essentially , the concrete building has become the building block of our time . </s>
almost a hundred years later , in 194@@ 7 , lego came out here . </s>
it was called the &quot; automatically commitment stone . &quot; </s>
and within a few years , lego was moving into every house@@ hold . </s>
it &apos;s esti@@ mated that over 400 billion st@@ ones were produced -- or 75 st@@ ones for every person on this planet . </s>
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful brid@@ ges or beautiful buildings . </s>
lego was making it possible for everybody . </s>
lego has basically taken the concrete building , the building block of the world , and made it a building block for our imagination . </s>
in the mean@@ while , in bell labs , bell labs were announced the next year , the next building block . </s>
the transi@@ stor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static , stac@@ ked building blocks to a world where everything was interactive . </s>
like the concrete block , the transi@@ stor allows us to build much larger , more complex circu@@ its , a stone after the other . </s>
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transi@@ stor was just for experts . </s>
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for experts , and so i decided to change it . </s>
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to put engineers into the hands of artists and designers . </s>
a few years ago , i started to develop in li@@ tt@@ ens . </s>
let me show you how they work . </s>
now li@@ tt@@ ing@@ es are electronic mod@@ ul@@ es that have a specific function of a specific function . </s>
they &apos;re designed to be light , sound , engine and sensor . </s>
and the best part is that they connect with magne@@ ts . </s>
you can &apos;t put them wrong in the wrong way . </s>
the st@@ ones are color co@@ ded . </s>
green is output , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange , cor@@ ds are cor@@ related . </s>
so all they need to do is connect a blue and a green one , and they can build very quickly larger circu@@ its . </s>
they put a blue on a green , and they can make light . </s>
you can put a switch in between , and you &apos;ve made a little di@@ mber . </s>
take the switch out to put out a pul@@ se , which is here , and they &apos;ve made a little blin@@ der . </s>
put this bu@@ zz@@ er for an addi@@ tional effect , and they &apos;ve made a l@@ ust machine . </s>
i &apos;m going to stop that . </s>
so to make the simple play , li@@ tt@@ its is actually quite powerful . </s>
instead of program you have to code , you have to have to program or solve li@@ fel@@ ong gest@@ ures with them with simple , intuitive gest@@ ures . </s>
so to acceler@@ ate the blind or slow down , they just turn on that button , and it makes the pul@@ ses faster or slo@@ wer . </s>
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ ine is that it &apos;s a growing library . </s>
we want to bring every single interaction in the world into a useful stone . </s>
lights , sound , solar pan@@ els , motors -- everything should be available . </s>
we &apos;ve spread li@@ tt@@ es for kids , and you see them playing with it . </s>
and it was an amazing experience . </s>
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electronics that you spend on the day and you don &apos;t learn in school ? </s>
like , for example , a light bul@@ b works or why the doors open up , or how an ipod respon@@ ds to touch . </s>
we also brought li@@ tt@@ al schools to design schools as well . </s>
so for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic terms , which started to play with li@@ tt@@ les as a material . </s>
so here we see , with fil@@ ters , paper and water bot@@ tles , like geor@@ ges ... </s>
a couple of weeks ago , we brought li@@ tt@@ es to ris@@ d and we gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just car@@ ton , wood and paper -- and told them , &quot; do something . &quot; </s>
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , which is a movement controlled con@@ fe@@ ction can@@ n@@ on . </s>
but wait , this is my favorite project , really . </s>
it &apos;s a bu@@ cket of pla@@ y-@@ do@@ h , who has fear in the dark . </s>
for these non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ ers became another material , and electronics became another material . </s>
and we want to make this material available for everyone . </s>
so li@@ tt@@ ine his open source . </s>
you can go to the website , you can down@@ load all the design ads and make them yourself . </s>
we want to encourage the world of the creation , the invent@@ or of the invent@@ or , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , belon@@ gs to us . </s>
so , pull out , and start to invent them . </s>
thank you . </s>
