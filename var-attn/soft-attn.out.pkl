just the knowledge that ja@@ gu@@ ar sch@@ am@@ ts still travel beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the importance of my@@ ths of in@@ u@@ it still are still full of meaning in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ ya that the budd@@ h@@ ist of the d@@ har@@ ma will still track the center of the d@@ har@@ ma , which is the idea that the central epi@@ ph@@ any of anthropolog@@ y is to memory , which is the idea that the world that we live in doesn &apos;t exist in absolute sense , but just as a model of reality , as a series of a group of certain possibilities for adap@@ ting our ance@@ stry , successful success@@ fully , many generations ago . </s>
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ t@@ ments . </s>
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world . </s>
we run through initi@@ ation ritu@@ als . </s>
we have to deal with the un@@ stopp@@ able separ@@ ation through death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art . </s>
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique pit@@ ch of the song , the rhyth@@ m of dance in every culture . </s>
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the pen@@ an in the forests of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ ths in haiti , or the war@@ ri@@ or in the ca@@ is@@ u@@ t desert of northern kenya , the cur@@ tain in the an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary , or a car@@ a@@ van in the middle of the sahara , and this happens to be the colleague where i went to the desert a month ago , or even a y@@ ak@@ -@@ she@@ pher@@ d on the hang of the q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , everest , the go@@ d@@ mother of the world . </s>
all these people teach us that there are other ways of existence , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ entation on earth . </s>
and this is an idea that , when you think about it , can only ful@@ fill one with hope . </s>
together , the in@@ t@@ act cultures in the world form a web of spiritual and cultural life that surro@@ und the earth and for the sa@@ ke of the earth as important as the biological habitat that you know of as bio@@ sphere . </s>
you can think of this cultural habitat as an eth@@ no@@ sphere . eth@@ no@@ sphere can be defined as the total sum of all thought and dreams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspiration and intui@@ tions that have been represented by human imagination since the beginn@@ ings of consciousness . </s> . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great legacy of human@@ kind . </s>
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re capable of as an incredibly knowledge species . </s>
and just as the bio@@ sphere has been strong , this was happening with the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- just a bigger speed . </s>
no biolog@@ ist , for example , would be to claim that 50 percent or more of all species are just about extin@@ ction , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic case in the biological diversity in biological diversity -- almost what &apos;s known as the most optimistic case of the cultural diversity of cultural diversity . </s>
and the cru@@ cial indi@@ c@@ ator of that is the extin@@ ction of languages . </s>
now , as any of you were born in this room , there were 6@@ ,000 languages spoken on earth . </s>
now , a language is not just the sum of the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a series of gra@@ m@@ mar beings . </s>
a language is the expression of the human mind . </s>
it &apos;s a means where the soul of a certain culture is access to the material world . </s>
each language is like an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned forest of mind , a turning point , an idea , an ecosystem spiritual opportunity . </s>
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , half of them no longer whis@@ per@@ ing into the ears of children . </s>
they &apos;re not teaching little kids anymore . that means , if nothing is under@@ taken , they &apos;re actually dead . </s>
what could be more lon@@ ely than being surrounded by s@@ wis@@ s , to be one of the last d@@ ash@@ es that speak your language , not have an opportunity to have the wisdom of the wisdom of the ancestors , or the hope of the hope to expect children ? </s>
and yet , this horrible dest@@ iny actually drives somebody else on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an el@@ derly person dies , and takes the last sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us of an old language . </s>
and i know that some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; would the world not be a better place if we all talk to a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be the language of yor@@ u@@ ba . let &apos;s be kan@@ ton@@ es@@ ic . </s>
let &apos;s be phot@@ i . &quot; </s>
and then you would suddenly see what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language . </s>
so today , i would like to take you on a journey today through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a short journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to understand what &apos;s actually been lost . </s>
now there are a few of us that kind of for@@ gotten that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of being , &quot; really different possibilities of being . </s>
for example , take this kid of bar@@ as@@ ana in nor@@ th@@ west of the amazon , the people of an@@ a@@ kon@@ da , believe that they came up with myth@@ ologically the mil@@ ky way from the east of hol@@ y sna@@ kes . </s>
this is a people that don &apos;t cogni@@ tively dist@@ ingu@@ ish between the colors of blue and green because , because the spi@@ ral of the forest is consi@@ stent by the forest that people depend on . </s>
they have a curious language and a mar@@ g@@ in@@ ary language called the lingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ og@@ ure : you have to mar@@ ry someone who talks to another language . </s>
all of this is ro@@ ot@@ ed in the myth@@ ological past . it &apos;s curious about these big houses that are talked about six or seven languages because of the mix@@ ed of six or seven languages , but you never hear somebody who lear@@ ns a language . </s>
they only listen and start to speak . </s>

she li@@ fted these photographs off the forest floor , tried to see the face of the face or the character , and found nothing and conclu@@ ded that this was the business cards of the de@@ vil , killing the five mission@@ aries with the spe@@ ars . </s>
but the wa@@ orange wa@@ ges didn &apos;t just kill the outside with the spe@@ ar . </s>
they went through each other . </s>
5@@ 4 percent of deaths went through through dri@@ ll@@ ing . </s>
we followed the gene@@ a@@ ology eight generations back and found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people about pres@@ enting a little bit about the fact that one of the people had become so old that he died because of his al@@ age , and we still killed him with the spe@@ ars . </s>
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing . </s>
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell the ur@@ ine of an animal from 40 steps , and determine what animal species was hearing about . </s>
in the early &apos; 8@@ 0@@ 0s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked me whether i was interested in going to haiti and in@@ fil@@ tra@@ zing the secret societies that were the foundation of du@@ v@@ ali@@ ans and clay ton ma@@ cou@@ tes , and the po@@ ison that was used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es . </s>
so , in order to make sense of that sen@@ sation , i had to know something about this remarkable faith of vo@@ dou@@ n , and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not cul@@ t of black magic . </s>
on the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical view . </s>
it &apos;s interesting . </s>
if i asked you to count the great world traditions , what would you say ? </s>
chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever . </s>
a continent is being left out , because the assu@@ mption was that in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , there was no religious faith in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , and of course , there was one and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is just the remains of this very profound religious thought during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of sla@@ very . </s>
but what vo@@ o@@ do@@ o does so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead . </s>
the living ones are making the spi@@ ri@@ ts . </s>
the spi@@ ri@@ ts can be acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ated by underneath water , answers to the rhyth@@ m of the dance , to den@@ y the soul of the living pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , so the ac@@ oly@@ matic moment for a brief sh@@ iny moment to the god . </s>
des@@ i@@ ties like to say the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like , &quot; your white goes to church and talk about god . &quot; </s>
we dance in the temp@@ le and become god . &quot; </s>
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re in your mind . how can you be done damage ? </s>
look at these amazing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ ths in a tran@@ ce@@ ca@@ tive state , the in@@ fl@@ ating coal without burn , an amazing illu@@ stration of the ability of the mind to influence the body &apos;s ability to keep it in a state of extre@@ mes . </s>
well , of all the people that i &apos;ve met were the eur@@ i from the sierra ne@@ v@@ ada de santa mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia , the most extraordinary . </s>
after the ancient ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ an civilization , who popul@@ ari@@ zed the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al level of col@@ om@@ bia , and over the course of con@@ quest , this people moved back into an isol@@ ated volcan@@ ic volcan@@ ic that goes up over the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in . </s>
in a bloo@@ dy stream , those people were the only ones who have never been con@@ qu@@ ered by the sp@@ ani@@ ards . </s>
up until today , they are gover@@ ned by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , but the education of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is very extraordinary . </s>
the young ac@@ oly@@ ths are separated at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a s@@ hal@@ low world of the fin@@ y@@ s , in stone cab@@ in@@ et of the gl@@ aci@@ er for 18 years , two peri@@ ods of time from nine years from each nine years from now to mi@@ mi@@ cking the nine months of preg@@ nan@@ cy that they put in the la@@ p of their local mother &apos;s mother , and now , now , me@@ tam@@ or@@ ic in the la@@ p of the great mother of the great mother . </s>
and throughout all of this time , they become cul@@ tur@@ ally introduced into the values of their society , values that keep the claim that their pra@@ yers and just their pra@@ yers , the cos@@ mic -- or we could say , the ecolo@@ gical -- equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um . </s>
at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day you will suddenly take out and the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , you see a sun@@ rise . and in this cryst@@ all@@ y-@@ clear moment of consciousness of the first light , when the sun begins to radiation the mag@@ ni@@ tude of the astonishing beautiful landscape , everything you &apos;ve learned in the abstract is what you &apos;ve learned in the abstract , and the pri@@ est step back and says , &quot; you see , you know , it &apos;s really what i &apos;ve been telling you . </s>
it &apos;s so wonderful . you must protect it . &quot; </s>
they call themselves the older brothers and they say that we are the younger brothers that are responsible for the destruction of the world . </s>
now this level of intuition becomes very important . </s>
whenever we think about in@@ fan@@ ts and landscape , we either con@@ j@@ ure r@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old ru@@ dder of the no@@ bl@@ ful wild , which in his simpli@@ fication is a ra@@ ging thought , or the other , th@@ ore@@ au , and saying , these people are connected to nature than we do . </s>
so , native americans are not sen@@ ti@@ mental , they &apos;re still du@@ mp@@ ed by the no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a . </s>
there isn &apos;t a lot of room for this in the malaria bur@@ st of as@@ m@@ at or the cold win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but yet , through time and ritual , a mysteri@@ ous ni@@ m@@ van of the earth is shaped , which is not based on the idea of being aware of it , but on a far more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist , because it &apos;s inv@@ aded into the human consciousness . </s>
now , what does that mean ? </s>
it means that a little child from the an@@ gles that grows in belie@@ ving that the mountain is an a@@ pu@@ -@@ spirit spirit that determin@@ es or its dest@@ iny will become a whole other person , and a different relationship with that resource or that place , as a little kid from mon@@ tana who &apos;s growing up in the belief that a mountain is a bunch of st@@ ones that can be taken off . </s>
whether it &apos;s an area of mind or a bunch of er@@ rors , it &apos;s ir@@ relevant . </s>
the interesting thing is the metaphor , which defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the nature of nature . </s>

it made me to another human being , under my friends under the k@@ wa@@ ki@@ u@@ l , who believe that these forests are the forest of hu@@ ku@@ k and the frozen sky and the can@@ ni@@ bal@@ an spi@@ ke and the can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ic spi@@ ders who live on the nor@@ the@@ ast of the world , spi@@ ri@@ ts that they would join their ha@@ mat@@ sa@@ -@@ initi@@ ation . </s>
well , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different reali@@ ties , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here . </s>
it &apos;s a photograph i just took last april in the nor@@ th@@ west of the amazon . </s>
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active pre@@ par@@ at from the re@@ per@@ toi@@ re of the sha@@ man . </s>
what makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca so fascinating is not just the pharma@@ colo@@ ous potential of this pre@@ par@@ ate , but the processing . it &apos;s really made of two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s this woo@@ den li@@ ane , which is a series of ta@@ pe@@ -@@ carb@@ ons , har@@ tension , har@@ mo@@ lin , easy hallu@@ cin@@ ations , a little bit more like the clim@@ bing plant alone is just as if a blue tr@@ unk of smoke la@@ ys on your consciousness , but it &apos;s mix@@ ed with the leaves of a fl@@ au@@ k of coffee from the family of coffee plants with the name of psych@@ ot@@ ria vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is . </s> . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>

if you &apos;ve seen y@@ an@@ o@@ mom@@ i , how you sna@@ p this stuff up , that sub@@ stance that you make from different species also contains metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ methan@@ yl@@ yl@@ on tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in . </s>
i &apos;m going to s@@ nu@@ ck up this po@@ w@@ der is something like being made out of a gun run by b@@ aro@@ pel@@ ing painting and land@@ ing on a ocean of electricity . </s>
there &apos;s not going to be a di@@ stor@@ tion of reality , but the resolution of reality . </s>
i even worked with my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ tes , the man who introduced the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c u@@ re@@ a to the discovery of magic mush@@ rooms in mexico in the &apos; 30 years , and i argu@@ ed that i was not able to put these tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine as a hallu@@ cin@@ ate , because in the moment you feel the effects , you &apos;re not there anymore to experience a hallu@@ cin@@ ation to a hallu@@ cin@@ ation . </s>
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is that they can &apos;t be taken in love , because of a human gut , of course , the enzy@@ me enzy@@ me enzy@@ me enzy@@ me , of course , with mon@@ o@@ am@@ in-@@ o@@ xi@@ di@@ ase . </s>
they can only be connected to some of the other chemicals that ma@@ o den@@ ies the ma@@ o . </s>
now what &apos;s fascinating is that the be@@ ta@@ x car@@ ol@@ ines that are in the li@@ ane , ma@@ o in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of exactly the way that we need to power the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . so ask yourself . </s>
how can these people come from a fl@@ ora of 8@@ 0,000 species of ad@@ str@@ er plants , these two mor@@ ph@@ ologically un@@ related plants that , if in this way together , create a kind of bio@@ chemical version , so that the whole thing is bigger than the sum of its parts ? </s>
we use this great eu@@ p@@ hemis@@ m , trial and error , which turns out to be meaning@@ less . </s>
but the indi@@ ans ask them to say , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot; </s>
so what does that mean ? </s>
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , has 17 vari@@ ants of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca that they all recognize at a large distance in the forest that appear for our eyes as a species . </s>
and then you ask them how to do their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y , and they say , &quot; i thought you had some plants . </s>
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot; </s>
well , it turns out that you take each one of the 17 vari@@ ants in the full moon and you sing them in a different volume . </s>
now that doesn &apos;t get a ph.@@ d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count than tri@@ ina . </s>
well , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have sym@@ pathy for the difficult position of in@@ fan@@ ts , you look at them as or@@ g@@ in@@ ell and color@@ ful , but somehow limit to the past while the real world , which is our world , is pro@@ gr@@ essing . </s>
so , the fact is that in the 20th century , in 300 years , you &apos;re not going to remember its war or technological innovation , but rather than an era where we were against and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on the planet either suppor@@ ted or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted . so the problem is not the change . </s>
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new living opportunities . </s>
and the problem is not the technology itself . </s>

not change and technology threat@@ ening the integri@@ ty of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the rule . </s>
and wherever you look around the world , you will find that these cultures are not com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible . these are the dynamic living peop@@ les that are going to be in@@ fer@@ red to the adap@@ t@@ ability of the custom@@ i@@ veness , whether it &apos;s going to be the great de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the home of the pen@@ sion , a people who lived in the ab@@ sen@@ ce of sou@@ the@@ ast asia , in sar@@ a@@ wa@@ k , a people who lived in front of a generation of sou@@ the@@ ast asia , and now it &apos;s de@@ vi@@ ty and prostit@@ ution on the river of the river , where you can see that even the flow of the mu@@ d that seems to be pollu@@ ted to the south chinese sea , which seems to be close to the hori@@ zon on the hori@@ zon , which is willing to fill your shi@@ eld rooms with ro@@ ws in the hori@@ zon
or if we go to the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i for@@ got a lot of for@@ gotten , you will see the ugly face of political domin@@ ance . </s>
you know , the geno@@ cide , the physical extin@@ ction of people is domin@@ ated in general , but the eth@@ no@@ ci@@ d , the destruction of the people , is not mer@@ ely con@@ vi@@ cted , but generally not con@@ vi@@ cted as part of a development strategy as part of a development strategy . </s>

con@@ gr@@ atu@@ lations on the top of nasa &apos;s en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed picture . </s>
now , let &apos;s get something else out of it . </s>
this is actually live on the internet . you can check it out . </s>
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which is really two different technologies connecting together . </s>
one is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ gon , and the other is a very good research on computer vision that from no@@ ah sna@@ kes , a university university student at the university of washington , under steve silk &apos;s coun@@ sel@@ ing at u@@ w . </s>
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ ski of microsoft was done . a very good collaboration . </s>
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ gon . </s>
you can see that when we create these kind of views where we can pen@@ et@@ rate through images and make this experience of multi-@@ fold . </s>
but the spa@@ tial ori@@ entation of images here is actually meaning . </s>
computer vision algorithms have held these images together by the real space of the real space that all had been made near the grass@@ lands la@@ kes in the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies , and you see the elements of stabili@@ zed slides of stabili@@ zed poetry or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic processing , and these things were all kind of connected in time with each other . </s>
i don &apos;t know if i still have time to show you other environments . </s>
there are ones that are much more spa@@ tial . </s>
i &apos;d like to just show you one of the original data sets of no@@ ah , and this is from a early prototype of photo@@ syn@@ th that we first worked in summer to show you what i believe is really the pun@@ ch@@ line behind this technology that &apos;s photo@@ syn@@ ths technology , and that &apos;s not necessarily so obvious if you look at the environments that we have on the website . </s>
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on . </s>
this is a re@@ construction of the ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al not@@ re lady who had only success@@ fully success@@ ed in the computer with images of fli@@ ck@@ r . just give an emergency lady in fli@@ ck@@ r , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-@@ shir@@ ts and on the university of college and so on . every single one of those orange bul@@ bs represents a picture that was dete@@ cted as a model of hearing . </s>
so these are all fli@@ ck@@ r@@ y-@@ pictures , and they &apos;re all right now in this way to relate to each other . </s>
and we can navi@@ gate that in a very simple way . </s>
. you know , i never believed i was going to work at microsoft eventually . </s>
i &apos;m very gr@@ ateful for the re@@ ception here . </s>
and i guess you can see that this is a lot of different cameras : it &apos;s all about the hand camera to professional sl@@ eng@@ ines , quite a large number of them that have all been su@@ cked up in this environment . </s>
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird things . </s>
many of them are covered by faces and so on and so forth . </s>
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are . </s>
this is actually a poster from not@@ re dame , which was really recorded . </s>
we can shift from poster to a physical view of that environment . </s>
and the point here is that we can put things on the social environment , and it &apos;s now being collected from all of us -- from the entire collective of how , visu@@ ally the earth looks -- and everything is connected to each other . </s>
all these pictures are connected to each other , and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts . </s>
they get a model that emer@@ ges from all over the earth . </s>
consider this as the sequ@@ el of the work of stephen law@@ ler to virtual earth . </s>
and that is something that , through the complexity that people use it , is growing and getting bigger and bigger for the user use of the user . </s>
their own photos are refle@@ cted with meta@@ data that has added another person to another person . </s>
if someone has gotten the effort and lab@@ eled all of this sa@@ ints and shares who they are all , then my photograph of the not@@ re dam@@ -@@ ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral will suddenly en@@ h@@ ance with all of this data , and i can use it as a starting point to go into this room to dive into this space , into these meta@@ sters using photos of other people and making a kind of a profound model of social experience with the use of other ven@@ ues . </s>
and of course , side product all of this is the immen@@ se rich virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that has not been kept by stre@@ t@@ ching or satellite images and so on , but by collective memory . </s>
thank you . </s>
do i understand it right ? your software allows at some point in time , within the next few years , all the images that are used by somebody in the world together are essentially inter@@ connected with each other in the world . </s>
yeah . she doesn &apos;t do anything else than discover . </s>
if they want , they create hyper@@ links between the images . </s>
and she does this because of the content in the pictures . </s>
and this is really exciting when you think about the amount of se@@ man@@ tic information that a lot of these images have . </s>
how if you take a web search for images where you enter sent@@ ences , and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what &apos;s going on . </s>
but what about if that picture you all over the place with all of your images ? </s>
then the range of se@@ man@@ tic cross com@@ pounds and the amount that comes out of it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network . </s>
bla@@ ise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart con@@ gr@@ atu@@ lations . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book from my book , like i hope , in harmon@@ y with other things that you &apos;ve heard already , and i &apos;m going to try to make a couple of connections for myself , if you will not . </s>
i want to start with what i call &quot; official do@@ g@@ ma . &quot; </s>
the official do@@ g@@ ma of what ? </s>
the official faith of all western industri@@ alized societies . </s>
the official do@@ g@@ ma works like this : if our goal is the ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing of our citizens &apos; well-being , it &apos;s all about ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the freedom of the individual . </s>
the reason for that is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , meaningful , an un@@ prece@@ d@@ ented pre@@ mis@@ e for the human . </s>
if human beings have freedom , each of us is to do for themselves to do the things that ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our community , and no one has to decide for us . </s>
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice . </s>
the more choices you have people , the more freedom you have , and the more freedom you have , the more common you have . </s>
this is , i think , as deep in our water supply that no one would ever be in the sense of questi@@ oning it . </s>
and it &apos;s also deeply ro@@ ot@@ ed in our lives . </s>
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress . </s>
this is my super@@ market . it &apos;s not a big deal . </s>
i just want to say a little bit about sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing . </s>
there are 17@@ 5 d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market when they don &apos;t count the 10 different o@@ live o@@ live o@@ live , and 12 bal@@ i@@ ds that they could buy to make a large number of their own sal@@ ad des@@ s@@ ings , which is the im@@ prob@@ able case that none of the 17@@ 5 people in the store are right . </s>
so that &apos;s what the super@@ market is . </s>
and then they go to the consumer electronics to put together a stere@@ o condi@@ tioning -- speakers , c@@ d-@@ player , a c@@ asse@@ tte player , radio , stronger . and in this one electronics , there &apos;s so many stere@@ o plants . </s>
we can put 6@@ .@@ 5 million different stere@@ o asse@@ ts together from the components that are offered in this one business . </s>
you have to admit that this is a huge choice . </s>
in other areas -- the world of communication . </s>
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could have every phone service you wanted to , as long as he got from ma bell . </s>
they r@@ ented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it . they didn &apos;t buy it . </s>
one of the consequences was that the phone had never broken . </s>
those days are over . </s>
we now have almost an infinite choice of tele@@ phones , especially in the world of mobile phones . </s>
these are the mobile phones of the future . </s>
my favorite is this in the middle -- mp@@ 3-@@ play@@ er@@ - , nas@@ -@@ ha@@ pping tri@@ mmer and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ ands l@@ é@@ e com@@ cles . </s>
and if you haven &apos;t seen it in your business yet , you can be sure you &apos;re going to soon get it . </s>
and what it does is it takes people to run the business and ask that question . </s>
now , you know what the answer to that question is ? </s>
and the answer is no . </s>
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much . </s>
in other aspects of life that are much more relevant than buying objects of objects , the same explosion is the same explosion of choice . </s>
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do . </s>
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could do a or we could do b . </s>
a has these benefits and risks . </s>
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ? </s>
and they say , &quot; doctor , what am i supposed to do ? &quot; </s>
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has these benefits and risks . </s>
what do you want to do ? </s>
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot; </s>
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot; </s>
the result is -- we call it the patient autonom@@ y . it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of the bur@@ den of responsibility for the meeting of someone who knows something -- nam@@ ely the doctor -- to someone who knows nothing and most likely is sick and therefore not the best constit@@ u@@ ency to make a decision -- nam@@ ely the patient . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescri@@ ption drugs for people like you and me that , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we don &apos;t buy them . </s>
why don &apos;t you adverti@@ se us if we don &apos;t buy it ? </s>
and the answer is : they expect us to call the doctor the next morning and ask a change of the prescri@@ ption . </s>
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice , as this slide is supposed to be . </s>
we don &apos;t inher@@ it identity ; we invent them . </s>
and we &apos;re inv@@ enting as much as we want . </s>
that means every day you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be . </s>
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which the standard assu@@ mption was that nearly everybody had one and they could get married as quickly as they could , and then as quickly as they could , as quickly as they could . </s>
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that . </s>
today , everything is easy to have . </s>
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do . </s>
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re less carefully carefully . </s>
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they wonder themselves , &quot; should i mar@@ ry or not ? should i mar@@ ry ? </s>
should i get married later ? should i have children or just career career ? &quot; </s>
they &apos;re all in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y questions . </s>
and they &apos;re going to answer those questions regar@@ d@@ less of whether that means to do all the tasks i agree with you and not get a good grade in my course . </s>
and in fact , they should . these are important questions for answer@@ ing questions . </s>
work -- we &apos;re bl@@ essed , as carl suggest@@ ed , with the technology that en@@ ables us to work every minute from every place on the planet , up to the rand@@ ol@@ ph hotel . </s>
there &apos;s actually a corner i &apos;m going to tell you about which i &apos;m not going to tell you about how the wir@@ el@@ ess@@ ness works . </s>
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it . </s>
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have to make decisions about how to make decisions , again and again , whether we should work or not work . </s>
we can look at our kids playing football , and we have our mobile phone on a hip , and our black@@ berry &apos;s on other hip , and our laptop probably la@@ ys on our la@@ p . </s>
and even if they &apos;re all turned off , every minute in which we look at our child with a soc@@ cer game mu@@ til@@ ator , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i take that call ? </s>
should i answer that email ? should i write that letter ? &quot; </s>
and also , when the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be their experience of the football game of her child than it would have been . </s>
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice . </s>
and the world that we lived in looked like this . </s>
i mean , there were some choices , but not all was a question of choice . </s>
and the world that we &apos;re living in now looks like this . </s>
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ? </s>
and the answer is yes . </s>
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it . </s>
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people . </s>
one effect , parado@@ x@@ ically , is that it &apos;s paraly@@ zed instead of free . </s>
so with so many options you can choose , people are very hard to decide at all . </s>
i &apos;m going to give you another dra@@ stic example of this , a study of invest@@ ments in volunteers . </s>
a colleague of mine had access to the investment records of van@@ gu@@ ard , the giant fund society of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs . </s>
and what she found was a 10 investment fund called the emplo@@ yer to the emplo@@ yment of two percent participa@@ tion . </s>
they provide 50 invest@@ ments in investment -- 10 percent less employees than if they were only providing five . why ? </s>
because there are 50 invest@@ ments that are for choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide that they &apos;re going to push it up in the morning . </s>
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never come tomorrow . </s>
now , understand that this is not just that people need to eat dog food if they reti@@ re , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , which means that the decisions are so hard to miss a lot of invest@@ ments in their emplo@@ yers . </s>
by non-@@ participa@@ tion , they spend up to 5,000 dollars a year on the emplo@@ yer who would have been happy to re@@ produce their contribu@@ tions . </s>
paraly@@ sis is a series of too many choices . </s>
and i think it causes the world to look like this . </s>
they want to make the decision really right if it &apos;s all e@@ ter@@ nity , right ? </s>
they don &apos;t want to choose the false investment fund , or the false sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing . </s>
so this is one effect . the other effect is that even if we get over the paraly@@ sis and make a decision , we end less satis@@ fied with the outcome of choice , as if we had the opportunity to choose between less possibilities . </s>
and there &apos;s a couple of reasons for this . </s>
one of them is caused by the large selection of a lot of sal@@ at@@ d@@ address , if they buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that they could have had another decision that would have been better . and what &apos;s happening is that this ima@@ gery made the decision to regre@@ t the decision , and this regre@@ t is negative to the happiness they made by their made , even if it was a good decision . </s>
the more opportunities we have , the more simple it is to regre@@ t at all that is disap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment to the choice they meet . </s>
second , which economists call op@@ per@@ tun@@ ity costs . </s>
dan gil@@ bert made a big spot this morning by telling them how much the way we grade things depends on what we compare to it . </s>
well , if there &apos;s lots and lots of alterna@@ tives to think about , it &apos;s just attra@@ ctive properties of alternative to the alterna@@ tives of alterna@@ te that makes them less pleas@@ ant with the alterna@@ tives that they &apos;ve selec@@ ted . </s>
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze . </s>
but here &apos;s what they should have thought . </s>
here &apos;s a couple on the ham@@ p@@ tons . </s>
very expensive real stat@@ ements . </s>
beautiful beach . great day . they have it all for themselves . </s>
what could be better ? &quot; dam@@ n &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august . </s>
everyone in my se@@ gment of my neighborhood is gone . </s>
i could park right in front of my house . &quot; </s>
and he takes two weeks from the thought that he missed the opportunity day , day after day , a great parking lot . </s>
op@@ per@@ tun@@ equ@@ ity costs the happiness that we get through our choices even when what we &apos;ve been looking for is fantastic . </s>
and the more opportunities for choice , the more attra@@ ctive properties of this choice are going to be considered to be in the op@@ per@@ tun@@ t costs . </s>
here &apos;s another example . </s>
now , this cartoon does a couple of stat@@ ements . </s>
he &apos;s making a statement about this right now , and maybe doing things about it . </s>
but one more important thing he does is , who they choose to do for one thing , they don &apos;t choose to do other things . </s>
and these other things may have a lot of attra@@ ctive properties , and it &apos;ll make what they &apos;re going to do less attra@@ ctive . </s>
third : es@@ cal@@ ating the expectations . </s>
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my je@@ ans . </s>
i wear je@@ ans , almost all the time . </s>
and there was a time where it was only je@@ ans in a way , and they bought them , and they fit bad@@ ly , they were incredibly un@@ com@@ promis@@ able , and if they wash@@ ed it long enough and they &apos;d often wash@@ ed enough , they started feeling &quot; ok . &quot; </s>
so to buy new je@@ ans after many years of the old age of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few je@@ ans , here &apos;s my size . &quot; </s>
and the sales guy said , &quot; do you want sna@@ ke , ligh@@ t-@@ lying or w@@ ing@@ sp@@ an ? </s>
do you want butt@@ ons or ri@@ vers ? wash@@ ing stone or ac@@ id ? </s>
do you want to know je@@ ans ? </s>
would you cut far down the bottom , bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h ... &quot; and so on , he said . </s>
my ja@@ w was down , and after i got re@@ covered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like the way that the only species used to be . &quot; </s>
he had no clu@@ e what this was , so i spent an hour trying to try all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and i left the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best pas@@ sage je@@ ans i had ever had . </s>
i got it better . all these choices made it better for me . </s>
but i felt worse . </s>
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain to myself . </s>
the reason i felt bad about it was with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good pair of je@@ ans are going to go up . </s>
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have any specific expectations when they were in some way . </s>
when they got into 100 species , fu@@ zz@@ y , one of them should have been perfect . </s>
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect . </s>
and so i got what i expected to get to what i was expe@@ cting , and what i expected to do was compared to what i expected . </s>
the adding of opportunities in people &apos;s lives inevi@@ t@@ ably , the expectations of people are going to have the potential of how well these possibilities are going to be . </s>
and that leads to less happiness with the results , even when the results are good . </s>
no one in the world knows this , because if they were , they all didn &apos;t know what it was about . </s>
the truth is more like this . </s>
the reason is that everything used to be better than anything worse than anything was worse , it was possible for people to make experience that was a pleas@@ ant surprise . </s>
today , in the world that we live in -- we &apos;re weal@@ thy , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfe@@ ction as an expec@@ tation -- the best for which you can ever hope is that things are as good as you antici@@ p@@ ated . </s>
they &apos;re never going to be pleas@@ ant , because their expectations , my expectations , are home . </s>
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all come from -- the secret to happiness is low expectations . </s>
i want to say -- a short auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal moment -- i &apos;m married to a woman , and she &apos;s really , really wonderful . </s>
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t let myself down . </s>
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , it &apos;s not always a bad thing . </s>
finally , a series of pur@@ ch@@ ases of a bad person , if there &apos;s only one way to buy , is that if they &apos;re un@@ satis@@ fied , and they wonder why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could they do ? </s>
when hundreds of different kinds of je@@ ans are available , and they buy one of the disap@@ poin@@ t@@ ments , and they ask why , who is responsible ? </s>
it &apos;s also so clear that the answer to the question is , you know . </s>
they could have done better than this . </s>
with 100 different types of je@@ ans in the house , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes . </s>
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel disap@@ pointed about it , they bl@@ ame themselves . </s>
clinical depression explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation . </s>
i believe a significant -- not the only one , but a significant contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the disap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences themselves , they think their fault would be their fault . </s>
and so the ima@@ gery is that it &apos;s generally better , obje@@ ctive , and we feel worse . </s>
so let me remind you . </s>
this is the official do@@ g@@ ma that one we &apos;re all holding for right now is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true . </s>
there &apos;s no question of a choice better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choices than a choice . </s>
there &apos;s a magic crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is . </s>
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time , which is the impro@@ v@@ ements in our community . </s>
now , as a basic question -- i &apos;m nearly done -- as a basic question , the thing about thinking about it , which is what allows all of these choices in the industri@@ alized societies , the material is wealth . </s>
there &apos;s lots of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them whose problem is not too much choice . </s>
your problem is you have too little . </s>
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies . </s>
and what &apos;s so fru@@ str@@ ating and angry is , steve levi@@ tt tells you yesterday about how this more expensive and hard car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money . </s>
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help . </s>
they even hurt . </s>
they make it worse for us to get there . </s>
if something of what makes the human society makes such decisions to make the societies in which people have been pus@@ hed too little choice , not just impro@@ ving people &apos;s lives , but going to be impro@@ ved by our dignity . </s>
economists call this a par@@ e@@ to impro@@ v@@ ements . </s>
income distribution is going to make it all better -- not just the poor -- because all of this major selection is sc@@ aling us . </s>
finally , read this cartoon , and , you know , a sophisticated person says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ? </s>
you know nothing can be done in this gold glass . &quot; </s>
and imagination , a short view of the world , is a short view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first . </s>
but the more i thought about it , the more i got to the point that the fish knows something . </s>
because the truth is , when you break up the gold glass so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paraly@@ sis . </s>
if you break the gold p@@ ill , so that everything is possible , it &apos;s going to give you the satis@@ fac@@ tion . </s>
they increase the paraly@@ sis and the sen@@ ti@@ ments satis@@ fac@@ tion . </s>
everybody needs a gold glass . </s>
this is almost to limited with perfect security -- possibly for fish , definitely for us . </s>
but the bar@@ rier , by a metaph@@ or@@ ical gold@@ fish glass , is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ ery , and , i guess , disaster . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before the human genome and what that might mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes . </s>
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new issue : we have di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new life and building new life . </s>
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions . </s>
what is life ? it &apos;s something i believe that many biologists have tried to understand and that in different levels . </s>
we tried a different approach to simpli@@ fying it to the minim@@ um components . </s>
we have di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed almost 20 years . when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , the shift from the analo@@ g world of biology was to the digital world of the computer . </s>
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can re@@ generate life , or whether we can make new life , from this digital universe ? </s>
this is a map of a small organism , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gei@@ tal@@ ium , who has the small@@ est genome of a species that can repli@@ cate itself in the laboratory , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with a smaller genome . </s>
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes from 500 or something like 500 or something like that . </s>
but if we look at this metaboli@@ c map that &apos;s very simple , compared to ours , trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all those genes that we can elimin@@ ate one by the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell . </s>
and so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to really synthes@@ ize that chromo@@ some is what allows us to vari@@ ate the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions . </s>
and so we started with the question , can we make a chromo@@ some synthes@@ i@@ zing ? </s>
does it allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules that have never been done before ? </s>
and if we can do that , can we start the chromo@@ some ? </s>
a chromo@@ some , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ fer@@ red chemical material . </s>
our steps in the di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zation of life were exponenti@@ ally . </s>
our ability to write genetic code has been evol@@ ving very slowly , but yet , and our final point is now going to be on an exponenti@@ al curve . </s>
we started with that 15 years ago . </s>
it took actually some years of starting with a bio@@ ethical review before we did the first experiments . </s>
and it turns out dna synthetic ti@@ zation is very hard . </s>
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make the small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ative process , so the longer you make a piece , the more er@@ rors happen . </s>
so we had to develop a new method where we could put those little pieces together and correct the mistakes . </s>
that was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 . </s>
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria killing bacteria . </s>
we made small pieces , made a error correc@@ tion , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters . </s>
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical chemical and gave it into a bacteri@@ um , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code , and made viral particles . </s>
the viral particles then were released by the cells and came back and kill e. col@@ i . </s>
recently , i &apos;ve been talking to the oil industry , and they said that they had this model right now . </s>
they laugh@@ ed more than you do here . </s>
so , we think that this is a situation in which the software is actually able to build its own hardware in a biological system . </s>
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build an entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some . it has more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters in genetic code . so we thought we could build it in c@@ asse@@ tte of the size of the virus to understand what the individual components of a living cell are . </s>
design is the key , and if you want to start using digital information in the computer , this digital information must really be missing . </s>
when we sequen@@ ced the genome in 199@@ 5 in 199@@ 5 , there was a mistake of error per 10,000 base pa@@ irs . </s>
we found 30 mistakes on the res@@ identi@@ al error . if we were using the original sequence , it would never have been possible . </s>
one part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long , and they need to over@@ la@@ p that with other 50-@@ letter pieces to build smaller sub-@@ units so that they could fit together . </s>
we &apos;ve built unique elements here . </s>
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built water@@ marks . </s>
think about it : we have a 4@@ -@@ letter code : a , c , g and t. </s>
tri@@ ple@@ ts of these letters -- these letters are about 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amin@@ o aci@@ ds . </s>
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sent@@ ences , thoughts . </s>
first of all , we just signed up . </s>
some people were disap@@ pointed that it was not poetry . </s>
we built the pieces so that we could just cr@@ ush them with enzy@@ mes , and we have enzy@@ mes that fix them and put them together again . </s>
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that held five to seven thousand letters , put those together around 24@@ ,@@ 000-@@ letter pieces to put these back together , up to 7@@ 2,000 . </s>
in every single step , we &apos;ve made these pieces of sur@@ plus that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute . </s>
we tried to get to the point of auto@@ mation . </s>
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball pla@@ yo@@ ff . </s>
when we get to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 base pa@@ irs -- they &apos;re not going to grow in e. col@@ i , and it goes over all the possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so we changed other mechanis@@ ms . </s>
we knew about a mechanism called the hom@@ ologist re@@ combination , which uses biology to repair dna that can assem@@ ble these pieces . </s>
here &apos;s an example of that . there &apos;s an organism called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ cus radio@@ dur@@ ans over the three million bike bike radiation . </s>
you can see in the upper field that his chromo@@ some just dro@@ ps apart . </s>
12 to 24 hours later , everything came together again as it was . </s>
we have thousands of organisms that can do that . </s>
these organisms can be completely dry , they can actually live in a vac@@ uum . </s>
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move around , looking for a@@ qua@@ tic conditions . </s>
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there . </s>
so here &apos;s a picture of the molecule that we made by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve just used he@@ pper mechanis@@ ms with the right design of the pieces , and then we mat@@ ched it . ye@@ ast is automatically putting it together . </s>
this is not a scan@@ ning electr@@ on shot that &apos;s a regular microscop@@ ic recording . </s>
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the light microscope . </s>
this is a photograph of six seconds in six seconds . </s>
this is the publi@@ cation we just recently comple@@ ted . </s>
that &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters on genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule that has ever been created by people . </s>
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million . </s>
if we were to print it with a size of 10 and without de@@ fault , it would include 14@@ 2 pages , just to print this genetic code . </s>
now how do we start a chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate it ? </s>
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , and it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria . </s>
it &apos;s also easier to do it in eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ ts like we do , and you just take the nucle@@ us out , and there &apos;s another one in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the c@@ lon@@ ing . </s>
arch@@ ae@@ bacteria is the chromo@@ some into the cell , but just recently , we &apos;ve shown that you can take a complete transplan@@ tation of a chromo@@ some from one cell to another , and that can activ@@ ate . </s>
we cle@@ aner the chromo@@ some of a micro@@ species . roughly said , these two as far as humans are and mice and mice . we gave some extra genes to pick up this chromo@@ some . we broke it with enzy@@ mes to destroy all the proteins , and it was quite amazing as we put it into a cell -- and they &apos;re going to estimate our very sophisticated graph@@ s here . </s>
the new chromo@@ some went into the cell . </s>
in fact , we thought that this is the end of the way , but we tried to get a little more on the process . </s>
that &apos;s the main mechanism of evolution here . </s>
we find all sorts of species here that have taken a second chromo@@ some , or a third of any where , every time thousands of tra@@ its in one second , added to a species . </s>
so people think evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed at a time has a lot to miss from biology . </s>
there are enzy@@ mes called restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that actually di@@ gest dna . </s>
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell has none ; the chromosom@@ es that we &apos;ve added already . </s>
it was ex@@ pri@@ tioned in the cell , and realized the other chromo@@ some as an alien material , and so at the end of the end , we had just a cell with a new chromo@@ some . </s>
it color@@ ed blue because of the genes that we had added . </s>
and after a very short period of time , it had lost all the characteristics of species , and con@@ ver@@ ted completely into a new species based on the new software that we put into the cell . </s>
all the proteins changed the membran@@ es -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve trans@@ fer@@ red . </s>
it may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ chim@@ y , but we can , by changing software dna , changing things quite dramatically . </s>
now , i &apos;ve been argu@@ ing that this is not the gene -- is based on 3.@@ 5 billion years of evolution . </s>
and i have argu@@ ed that perhaps we could create a new form of cam@@ brian explosion in which there could be massive new species of bio@@ diversity based on this digital design . </s>
why would we do that ? </s>
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need . </s>
we &apos;re growing from six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years . </s>
to put it in my context , i was born in 194@@ 6 . </s>
today three people on this planet have existed for everyone in 194@@ 6 ; within 40 years , it will be four . </s>
we have problems with food , with fresh water and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6@@ .@@ 5 billion people . </s>
it &apos;s going to challenge a challenge for nine . </s>
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30-@@ plus billion bar@@ rel@@ s of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million bar@@ rel@@ s a day . </s>
when we think about biological processes , or some process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge . </s>
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 of this material that goes into the atmosphere . </s>
we now have , from our discoveries from around the world , a datab@@ ase of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future . </s>
the electr@@ on@@ em@@ an industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of that . </s>
so , we &apos;re starting to think about the limits of biological reality and the limits of the biological reality . </s>
we have technologies today due to these ra@@ pid synthes@@ i@@ ties to do what we call combin@@ at@@ or@@ ic gene@@ tics . </s>
we now have the possibility to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosom@@ es a day . </s>
if you imagine to make these 20 million different genes or optimi@@ ze these processes to make oc@@ tan , or medi@@ cin@@ es , we can change more molecular biology biology than the last 20 years of science . </s>
and it &apos;s only just a selection of selection . we can selec@@ tively selec@@ te for life , production of chemicals or fuel production , and so on . </s>
this is a shot of actual design software that we &apos;re working on , which is actually to sit down and start designing new species on the computer . </s>
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly what their genetic code will look like . </s>
now , we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation of the fourth generation . </s>
you &apos;ve recently seen corn to ethan@@ ol , which is just a bad experiment . </s>
we have the number of second , and third generation that will come out relatively soon that will have much higher levels of sugar , such as oc@@ tan@@ tan or different kinds of bu@@ tan@@ ol . </s>
but , as we think , the only way in which biology is going to have a huge impact on the cost of food or limit@@ ation of their avail@@ ability is if we see co2 as an ex@@ pos@@ ure material , and that &apos;s why we work on cells that go out that way . </s>
and we think that we will be the first to be the fourth generation of the fourth , and this is in about 18 months . </s>
sunlight and co2 are a method . </s>
-- but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways . </s>
this is an organism that we described in 199@@ 6 . </s>
it lives in the deep sea , about one and a half miles deep , in almost bo@@ iling water temper@@ atures . </s>
it &apos;s trans@@ forming co2 in methan@@ e from using hydrogen as a source of energy . </s>
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use stor@@ ed co2 that can just be brought into production stores , conver@@ ting the co2 into fuel to drive this process . </s>
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental issues of life . </s>
you know , we really have -- moder@@ ate goals like the replac@@ ement of the entire pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry . right . if you couldn &apos;t do this at ted , where else ? a major source of energy to get energy . </s>
but we &apos;re now working on using the same approach to developing the same approach@@ es for developing vaccin@@ es . </s>
you &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we &apos;re always in the back of a year , and you have a dollar for a dollar when it comes to the right vaccine . </s>
i think that &apos;s going to be changed by making re@@ combine vaccin@@ es in adv@@ ance . </s>
that is what the future might look like with changes , can acceler@@ ate the evolutionary tree today with synthetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ en , and possibly eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ ites . </s>
we are light years from it to improve people &apos;s light , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much . </s>
at the last ted conference , i gave a introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c . </s>
and i promis@@ ed to come back to explain how the machine works . </s>
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of those who were not there , the l@@ h@@ c is the biggest scientific experiment that ever happened -- 27 miles across the diam@@ eter . </s>
his job is to create the conditions that exist less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe -- and that &apos;s up to 600 million times within one second . </s>
it &apos;s just brea@@ th@@ taking ambi@@ tious . </s>
this is the machine underneath gen@@ ev@@ a . </s>
we &apos;re taking pictures of these mini@@ -@@ si@@ zed pictures in dete@@ ctors . </s>
this is what i &apos;m working on . he &apos;s called at@@ las dete@@ ctor -- 4@@ 4 meters in the wid@@ th , 22 meters across the diam@@ eter . </s>
this is a spectacular picture of the at@@ las in the construction so that you see the scale . </s>
on september 10@@ th last year , the machine ran for the first time . </s>
and this picture was taken by at@@ las . </s>
it caused huge je@@ als in the control of the control room . </s>
it &apos;s a picture of the first crimin@@ al exchange of radiation that came back all the way around the l@@ h@@ c , and then deli@@ ber@@ ately colli@@ ded with one part of the l@@ h@@ c to make an rain of particles pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ cing on the dete@@ ctor . </s>
in other words , when we saw this image on september 10@@ th , we knew that the machine was working , which is a big tri@@ um@@ ph . </s>
i don &apos;t know if this created the biggest ju@@ g , or this is when somebody went to visit the google side of the google page , and that was the front page . </s>
it means that we have reached a cultural influence next to the scientific . </s>
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had these wir@@ es to do here -- these golden wir@@ es here . </s>
these wir@@ es lead 13@@ -@@ thousand am@@ p@@ ere when the machine is running up . </s>
now , the engineers under you will look at them and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t . these are little wir@@ es . &quot; </s>
you can afford that because if you cool@@ ed it very far , you become what you call a super@@ conduc@@ tor . </s>
so with minus 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ older than the room between the stars , they can keep that tension out of the way . </s>
in one of the connections between over ne@@ un@@ thousand magne@@ ts in the l@@ h@@ c , there was a factory defe@@ ct . </s>
and by doing so , the wir@@ es heat down , and 13@@ -@@ thousand am@@ p@@ ere en@@ counter@@ ed , suddenly electrical resistance . </s>
this was the result . </s>
now , this is all amazing when you imagine that the magne@@ ts wei@@ gh over 20 tons and shif@@ ted by about 30 inches . </s>
so we damage about 50 of the mag@@ net &apos;s magne@@ ts . </s>
and they had to elimin@@ ate what we did . </s>
and we re@@ wired them , they re@@ pa@@ i@@ red it . </s>
they &apos;re all over their way back to their way . </s>
by the end of march , the l@@ h@@ c will be re@@ stor@@ able . </s>
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and we expect to collect first data in june or ju@@ ly , and we continue our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are . </s>
well , of course , in some ways , the debate again is the debate about the value of science and engineering to those limits . it &apos;s easy to reje@@ ct something like this . </s>
i think that the fact is that it &apos;s so hard to reach beyond our limits , the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c , the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c . </s>
i &apos;m going to leave my final words of an english scientist . hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y da@@ vy , who , as i suspe@@ ct , defen@@ ded the us@@ eless experiments of his app@@ n@@ ings , his teacher was michael far@@ a@@ day , he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind than accep@@ ting that our scientific imagination is final , that there are no myster@@ ies in nature that our tri@@ um@@ ph are full , and that there are no new worlds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot; </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;m a writer . </s>
writing books is my prof@@ ession , but it is , of course , more than that . </s>
it &apos;s also my big , li@@ fel@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation . </s>
and i &apos;m not expe@@ cting that this will ever change . </s>
however , there &apos;s a little bit of funny stuff about my life and career that has led me to completely re@@ think my relationship to this work . </s>
now , this weird event was that i recently wrote a book -- a bi@@ ograph@@ y called the arts , pra@@ y , love -- that , rather than all of my previous books , went out in the world for any reason , and a big mega@@ -@@ event , international best pol@@ s@@ ell@@ er thing became . </s>
the result is that , no matter where i &apos;m coming from , i &apos;m being treated as if i &apos;m not going to under@@ mine it . </s>
seriously -- the under@@ graduate . </s>
for example , they &apos;re very worried about me and saying , &quot; don &apos;t you worry that you &apos;re never going to get past this success ? </s>
do you have no fear of writing your whole life , and never again creating a book that is interested in anybody in the world ? never again ? </s>
okay , that &apos;s really , really courage . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s>
it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was going to tell you about 20 years ago when i first told you that i was a writer that i wanted to be a writer in the same way that i had the same kind of fear of an@@ x@@ iety . </s>
people were saying , &quot; you don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re not afraid of success ? &quot; </s>
have you no fear that the humili@@ ation of humili@@ ation is going to kill you ? </s>
don &apos;t you worry that you &apos;re going to leave this piece of craft and never make anything out of it , and that you &apos;re going to die on a ro@@ gue record of dreams -- your mouth filled with the bit@@ ter a@@ er@@ ial of failure ? </s>
so , you know . </s>
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : yes , you know . </s>
yeah , i &apos;m scared of all these things . </s>
and i always had it . </s>
and i &apos;m going to fear a lot more things that no one would know . </s>
like al@@ ga@@ e -- and other frighten@@ ing things . </s>
but when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently , and i &apos;m asking myself , &quot; why ? </s>
is that sensi@@ ble ? </s>
is it logical that someone should be expe@@ cted to do the job of doing the work that he &apos;s working on ? </s>
and what &apos;s going on with the creative challenges that they make us un@@ safe about each other &apos;s mental state -- in a way that other jobs don &apos;t do ? </s>
my father , for example , was chemi@@ sts , and i can remember no situation in his 40 years as a chem@@ ist who was asked if he was scared to be chemi@@ sts . </s>
with your chemistry block@@ age , john -- how are you going to do with this ? </s>
it just didn &apos;t come , you know ? </s>
but to be fair -- the group of chemi@@ sts over the centuries have not given the call of al@@ co@@ hol addi@@ ction to man@@ -@@ depression . </s>
but we seem to have the writers that seem to have this kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creative of all gen@@ res , seem to have this reputation , mentally , incredibly un@@ stable . </s>
all you need to do is to look at the bit@@ ter death numbers of really great heads in the 20th century alone , who died young and often by their own hand . </s>
and even those who didn &apos;t actually protect suicide seemed to have been really ne@@ gle@@ cted by their tal@@ ents . </s>
nor@@ man ma@@ iler , shor@@ tly before his death in his last interview , was to kill each other of my books a little bit further . </s>
it &apos;s an extraordinary statement that they can do about their lives . </s>
but we don &apos;t even say that if we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve seen these kinds of stat@@ ements for as long as so long , we kind of have the notion of this kind of inter@@ ior and collective that creativity and suffering kind of bel@@ ong together , and that art -- at the end of the end -- always leads to sea tor@@ ture . </s>
the question i &apos;d like to ask everyone here today is : is this idea to you right now ? </s>
i mean , feel that ? because with only one centi@@ meter -- i don &apos;t feel comfortable with that perception at all . </s>
i find her secre@@ cy . </s>
and i find them dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch her take over the next century . </s>
i think it &apos;s better if we &apos;re going to live our great creative m@@ under@@ s . </s>
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start cat@@ ching this dark path of gu@@ essing -- especially in the fact that i just find myself in my career . </s>
that &apos;s called -- look : i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old . </s>
i have maybe another 40 years of work in me . </s>
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now is the world as the work that came after the pas@@ sage success of my last book , right ? </s>
i &apos;m just saying it , because now we &apos;re all kind of friends here -- it &apos;s probably most likely that my biggest success is behind me . </s>
oh , jesus , what a thought ! </s>
that &apos;s the kind of thought that someone can get someone to catch up at nine o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to . </s>
i would rather continue to do this work that i love . </s>
so the question is : how ? </s>
after some time of refle@@ ction , i seems to be able to continue to write , design , to design a kind of prote@@ ctive psychological constructed . </s>
in some way , i have to find a way of writing a safe distance between me and my very natural ad@@ ver@@ sity about how the reaction will be to the prescri@@ ption . </s>
while i was looking for models that last year to do this , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if you could see whether you might have better or more sensi@@ ble ideas about how to help creative risks with the emotional risks associated with creativity . </s>
this is what took me to the old gre@@ e@@ ce of gre@@ e@@ ce and the old ro@@ me . </s>
please join me , because the circle will end again . </s>
but in the ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ro@@ me , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ? </s>
they believed that creativity was a kind of di@@ vin@@ ely di@@ stor@@ ted spirit that comes from a distant , un@@ familiar source of people -- from un@@ explained , un@@ seen , unknown reasons . </s>
the gre@@ e@@ ks call these di@@ vine den@@ ds of creativity of creativity . </s>
well , by soc@@ rates , he &apos;s known that he would have a l@@ um@@ p that he ref@@ used to carry on from far away . </s>
the tu@@ mer had the same idea , called this kind of body em@@ bas@@ sy of creative mind . </s>
that &apos;s great . the tu@@ mer didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual . </s>
they believed that a genius was this kind of ma@@ gical di@@ vine creature that believed that it literally lives in the walls of an artist &apos;s walls -- sort of like do@@ bby , the house@@ hold -- who came out and the artists in the work would kind of assi@@ sted invisible and make the outcome of the work . </s>
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological constructed that suppor@@ ts you from the consequences of your work . </s>
and everybody knew it worked so well , right ? </s>
the artist &apos;s artists was protected in front of some things , like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism , right ? </s>
if your job was brilliant , you didn &apos;t want to look at it all for you . everybody knew that you had this dis@@ par@@ ate genius that helped you . </s>
if your work fl@@ ed -- not entirely your mistake , right ? </s>
everybody knew , your genius was kind of laugh@@ ing . </s>
so the people in the west thought really a long time about creativity . </s>
and then the ren@@ ais@@ s@@ ance and everything changed . and we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all go@@ ds and mystery , and there &apos;s no room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures to take orders from di@@ vin@@ ity . </s>
it &apos;s the beginning of the rational human@@ ism , and people began to think that creativity completely came from its individual . </s>
for the first time in history , people are hearing this genius or a genius of those artists -- instead of having a genius of genius . </s>
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake . </s>
you know , i think an ordinary person to allow him to think he or she is like the ves@@ sel , like the bas@@ in and the essen@@ ce and the source of all di@@ vine , creative , un@@ familiar , infinite mysteri@@ ous , a little bit too much responsibility to a question of a questi@@ on@@ na@@ ge , human mind . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
it &apos;s like asking somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the sun . </s>
and it turns out , and di@@ stor@@ ted entire e@@ gos , and it creates all of these un@@ available expectations for success . </s>
i think that this success pressure has del@@ a@@ yed our artists for the last 500 years . </s>
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question . </s>
can we change it ? </s>
perhaps to be an ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery and mystery of the creative creative . </s>
maybe not . </s>
we may not be able to do rational human@@ -@@ human@@ -@@ rational human@@ ism in an 18@@ -@@ minute basis in an 18@@ -@@ minute talk . </s>
and there are certainly people in this audience who are really ad@@ vis@@ ing scientific doubt about the idea of -- are basically -- fe@@ es that followed people and fe@@ a@@ thers to their projects and fe@@ a@@ thers on their projects and so on . </s>
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on that journey . </s>
but the question i want to throw out is : why not ? </s>
why not think that way ? </s>
because it &apos;s as much sense as anything i &apos;ve heard about when it was about explaining the absolutely in@@ san@@ e cap@@ ability of creative process . </s>
a process that &apos;s going on -- as anyone who has ever tried to make something -- in other words , everyone here -- is not always sensi@@ ble . </s>
in fact , sometimes he can feel straight to par@@ an@@ or@@ n . </s>
i recently had a meeting like this when i met the extraordinary american poet ru@@ th stone , who now was about 90 years old , but she was telling me that she was growing up in the fields of village in the village , working out on the fields . she said she would feel like a poem about the landscape on her . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
she said it was like a d@@ res@@ sing train in air . </s>
it would roll over the country on the land . </s>
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet . </s>
she knew she could do just one moment in one moment , and that was -- in their words -- the de@@ vil run like the de@@ vil . </s>
she ran like the de@@ vil to the house as she was tra@@ cked by this poem , and it was only about the fact that she had to go quickly enough into a piece of paper and a pen , so she could catch it through her , and he could catch it on the side . </s>
in other painting , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t reach the house and she roll@@ ed the poem through her and she missed it . she said it was going to go on over land and -- as she said -- i &apos;d look for another poet . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;m not going to forget that part -- she said there were moments in which they were almost missed . </s>
so she runs out to the house , and he looks for the paper and the poem goes through her , and she grab@@ s a pen when she goes through her , and then she goes through her -- she said it was as if she had to reach with her other hand and get it to grab it . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
she caught the poem on his tail , and she pulled it back into her body and kno@@ cked it on the sheet of paper . </s>
in those opportunities , the poem came in and in@@ t@@ act on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first time . </s>
and when i listen@@ ed to that , i thought it was incredibly sin@@ i@@ ster -- that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is going on . </s>
it &apos;s not like my creative process at all -- i &apos;m not the channel . </s>
i &apos;m a wall animal . in order to work , i have to stand up at the same time every day and swe@@ at me , ti@@ gh@@ ted me , and really un@@ pleas@@ ant . </s>
but even when i was in my mouth , sometimes i was making this thing . </s>
and i estimate that many of you have done this too . </s>
even i had work or ideas that came out of a source through me that i really can &apos;t identify . </s>
what is this thing for ? </s>
and how do we deal with it without losing our minds , but in the opposite , even in mental health ? </s>
for me , the best living example of how to create this is the musi@@ cian tom wa@@ it , and i had intervie@@ wed it for a magazine a few years ago . </s>
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life was tom the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the belo@@ ved modern artist who was trying to do these un@@ controlled creative impul@@ ses that lived in it and to come along with them . </s>
but then he got older and more quie@@ tly . he told me that one day he was on a fa@@ stest road in los angeles , and it changed everything for him . </s>
he was driving at high speed when he suddenly hearing a little frag@@ ment of a melo@@ dy that , as it often is in inspiration , is very tan@@ gible for him , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s pra@@ ying . he &apos;s pra@@ ying , but he can &apos;t grab it , but he can &apos;t touch it . </s>
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have any c@@ asse@@ tte recor@@ ders . </s>
so he starts to get this old climb up in him , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;ll be tra@@ cked by this song forever . </s>
i &apos;m not good enough ; i &apos;m not able to do it . </s>
but instead of getting pan@@ ic , he just stopped . </s>
he ended the whole thought , and he did something completely new . </s>
he just looked up in the sky , and he said , excuse me , can you see i don &apos;t see that i &apos;m driving car driving ? </s>
what am i looking for as could i just write a song ? </s>
if you really want to exist , come to a less positive moment when i can take care of you . </s>
if you &apos;re not , th@@ um@@ b today is somebody else . </s>
go and qu@@ aw@@ le leon@@ ard co@@ hen . make a difference . </s>
his whole work process has been changed . </s>
not the work itself . it was often as dark as e@@ h and ever . </s>
but the process , and the heavy reference that surro@@ unds it was li@@ fted up when he took the genius out of it , where he didn &apos;t make anything , and then he left it where he came from , and he realized that it didn &apos;t have an inter@@ ior , tor@@ ture thing . </s>
it could give an ow@@ ner , wonderful , bizarre , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the stran@@ gen@@ ess thing that was not quite tom . </s>
now , when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit as i worked , and it kind of saved me . </s>
this idea saved me as i was in the middle of the writing of the arts , pra@@ y , lo@@ y , love , and i fell into one of these pi@@ pes of doubt that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and not going to work . you start to think that it will be a disaster . it &apos;s going to be the worst book that has been written . </s>
not just bad , but the worst ever ever . </s>
i started thinking , i should just plu@@ g the project up . </s>
but then i remember@@ ed how tom talked to the free sky , and i tried . </s>
so i put my view at the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and i talked to my com@@ ment towards a empty empty corner of the room . </s>
and i said , &quot; stop , you , you know , you , you and i , you know , when this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ? </s>
because you see , i &apos;m invest@@ ing with everything i &apos;ve got . i don &apos;t have any more . </s>
so if you want to have it better , you &apos;ve got to check up here and keep your fra@@ ction of the process . </s>
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the hell with it . </s>
i &apos;m going to continue to write further , because that &apos;s my job . </s>
and i want to leave you with proto@@ co@@ l that i was here today for my part of the jobs here . </s>
because ... and by the end , it &apos;s like follo@@ ws . centuries ago , in the deser@@ ti@@ est north africa , people have gather@@ ed people to mo@@ dest dan@@ ces and music that have been stopped for hours of time -- until the da@@ wn of da@@ wn . </s>
these fe@@ sts were always great , because the dan@@ cers were professional and they were fantastic . </s>
but over and over again , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors was actually overwhel@@ ming . </s>
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen this kind of performance in your life . </s>
it was as if the time was still , and the dan@@ cer dan@@ cers are going through some kind of p@@ ale . he did nothing else than he ever did before -- 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything was added . </s>
and all of a sudden , he no longer seemed to be human anymore . </s>
it was ligh@@ ted by the inside , and it was ligh@@ ted from the bottom , and it all ill@@ umin@@ ated through a di@@ vine fire . </s>
when this was happening , people knew what they were . they called it to his name . </s>
they put the hands together , and they started singing : who@@ an al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god . </s>
that &apos;s god , you know ? </s>
interesting histor@@ ic foot@@ note : when the mo@@ cks of southern spa@@ in were con@@ qu@@ ering it , they brought this practice . the language changed over the centuries of centuries al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h paint to ben ol@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ é mr@@ a that you still have to fight and hear the fl@@ ames of fl@@ am@@ en@@ o dan@@ ces . </s>
if a performance in spa@@ in has done something like a ma@@ gical piece of ma@@ gical , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , al@@ la@@ h , great , bra@@ vo &apos;s un@@ concei@@ vable , there it is : a gli@@ mp@@ se of god . </s>
and that &apos;s great , because we need this . </s>
but , the tri@@ cky part follo@@ ws the next morning , when the dan@@ cer wa@@ kes itself up and reali@@ zes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;@@ clock in a tu@@ es@@ day -- and he no longer does a fifth of god . </s>
he &apos;s just an aging mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ge with painful k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he will never go back to those hei@@ ghts . </s>
and maybe somebody will ever call a god of god when he turns , but what would he like to do with the rest of his life ? </s>
that &apos;s hard . </s>
this is one of the most painful correc@@ tion of a creative life . </s>
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be that full of embarras@@ s@@ ment , if you haven &apos;t believed in the beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence could come from them . </s>
if you just believe you &apos;re a ligh@@ t@@ weight -- from a uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able source for an un@@ read@@ able time of your life that &apos;s passed on somebody else , if you &apos;re done with it . </s>
when we start to think like this , it changes everything . </s>
and so i started thinking , and so i think with safety in the last month , while i was working on the book , that &apos;s going to appear soon -- as the dangerous , scary , powerful after@@ ward of my des@@ cen@@ ded success . </s>
whatever i have to say to myself , when i get crazy about this , i &apos;m not afraid . </s>

last year , i showed these two slides to illu@@ strate that the arctic ice cap@@ s , which had close to the bottom of the lower 48 , was shr@@ unk to 40 percent . </s>
but this doesn &apos;t mean very strong enough of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thi@@ ck of the ice . </s>
in a sense , the arctic ice cap@@ s is the be@@ ating heart of our global climate system . </s>
it grows in winter and shr@@ in@@ ks in the summer . </s>
the next slide i &apos;m going to show is a ti@@ me-@@ lap@@ se picture of what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years . </s>
the permanent ice is lab@@ eled with red . </s>
as you can see , it &apos;s growing on the dark blue . this is the an@@ nu@@ al ice in winter , and it shr@@ unk in the summer . </s>
the so-called permanent ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood that &apos;s fli@@ pping out of the body here . </s>
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here to here . </s>
this is a problem , as warming the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , where there are large quanti@@ ties of frozen carbon , which , when it de@@ als , is imple@@ mented by microbes to methan@@ e . </s>
compared to the whole amount of climate change in the atmosphere , this amount could double if we tran@@ sc@@ end this critical point . </s>
today , in some flat la@@ kes in alas@@ ka methan@@ e , from itself , they &apos;re out of the water . </s>
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ter at the university of alas@@ ka has traveled to another group of work to another black lake last winter . </s>

in california , a 40 percent reduction was seen by the snow cei@@ ling in sierra . </s>
it &apos;s affec@@ ting the memory . </s>
and the predictions as you &apos;ve read are serious . </s>
that au@@ stra@@ ction throughout the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire . </s>
and the dis@@ ast@@ ers all over the world have been in a really extraordinary and un@@ prece@@ d@@ ented ex@@ pos@@ ure . </s>
four times as many in the last 30 years as the previous 7@@ 5@@ 0s . </s>
this is a completely un@@ sustainable development pattern . </s>
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing . </s>
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day into the oceans . </s>
look at the area of eastern pacific , the american continent of western continent , of the american continent of the indian sub@@ continent , where there is a dramatic decline in oxygen in the ocean . </s>
the biggest single factor for global warming , besi@@ des de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent , is burning fossil fuels . </s>
oil is a problem , and coal is the equivalent of the biggest problem . </s>
the united states is one of the two largest pollu@@ tors , along with china . </s>
and the pro@@ pos@@ al was to build a lot more carbon fac@@ tories . </s>
but we start to see a change . </s>
here are the ones that have been stri@@ pped in the last few years with some green alterna@@ tives that have been pro@@ posed . </s>
mor@@ e@@ over , there &apos;s a political dis@@ per@@ se in our country . </s>
and the co@@ hl@@ ars and oil industries have spent a quarter of a billion dollars last cal@@ en@@ dar@@ s in order to pro@@ mote clean coal , which is a con@@ tradi@@ ction in itself . </s>
this picture reminded me of something . </s>
in order for christmas , at my house in ten@@ nes@@ see , a billion tons of cooking lam@@ bs . </s>
you saw it , obviously , in the news , in the news . </s>
this is in our entire country of the second largest waste flow of america . </s>
this was what happened for christmas . </s>
one of the commer@@ ci@@ als of co@@ hl@@ ence &apos;s co@@ her@@ ence for christmas was this . </s>
fro@@ sty the carbon is a happy , happy guy . </s>
it &apos;s in sc@@ ou@@ ts and abund@@ ance in america , and it helps to grow our economy . </s>

it &apos;s affordable and lo@@ an@@ ous , and workers stay in lo@@ ans and bread . </s>
this is the source of most coal in west virginia . </s>
the most powerful mountain worker is the la@@ dder of mas@@ sey coal . </s>
let me say one very clear : al gore , nan@@ cy pel@@ o@@ si , harry ri@@ d , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about . </s>
so , the alli@@ ance of climate protection has two campaig@@ ns . </s>
this is one , a part of her . </s>
at co@@ al@@ er@@ gic , we &apos;re seeing climate change as a serious danger to our business . </s>
that &apos;s why we set it up to the top line , giving it a significant amount of money to get an ad on the way in order to get the truth over coal . </s>
the fact is , coal is not dirty . </s>
we think it &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s also sm@@ elling well as well . </s>
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change . </s>
let &apos;s leave that to us . </s>
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . </s>
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean carbon factory . </s>
fantastic ! this machine is quite no@@ is@@ y . </s>
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology . </s>
and yet , coal is one of the key reasons of global warming , the remarkable clean carbon technology that you see here changes everything . </s>
now look at this closely , this is today &apos;s clean coal technology . </s>
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge for national security challenge . </s>
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis . </s>
the red thre@@ ad that conne@@ cts them all together is our depen@@ dence on carb@@ on-@@ based fuels like dirty coal and foreign oil . </s>
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us out of this in@@ san@@ e situation . </s>
supply america has a 100 percent clean electricity over the next 10 years in the next 10 years . </s>
a plan to bring america back to work is to make ourselves sa@@ fer and to help stop global warming . </s>
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems . </s>
n america new . find more . </s>
this is the last . </s>
it &apos;s about a no@@ vel@@ ty of america . </s>
one of the fa@@ stest ways , our depen@@ dence on ancient , dirty fuels that acqui@@ re our world . </s>
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system . </s>
new invest@@ ments in order to create well-@@ paying jobs . </s>
provi@@ ders are new america . it &apos;s time to accept reality . </s>
there &apos;s an old african saying : &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone . &quot; </s>
if you want to come far , go together . &quot; </s>
we have to come a long way , quickly . </s>
thank you . </s>
i want to start by asking you to think about the time of your childhood than you were playing with the lo@@ c@@ ality . </s>
as they realized how to stre@@ tch the hands out and interven@@ e that would take the sound and move it , they actually learned to think and to understand problems through the understanding of the space and the changes of spa@@ tial co@@ vers . </s>
the spa@@ tial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our surro@@ und@@ ings . </s>
as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- together with my professional pat@@ ti , and my colleague pat@@ ti and my colleague , je@@ ev@@ an kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i , i began to wonder : what if we were using computers , instead of a mouse show , which is like a digital finger@@ ti@@ st , which moves like a digital finger@@ ti@@ p on a flat piece of labor -- -- what if we could interven@@ e with both hands and inter@@ f@@ ere with the data and put them in the way that we want to do it ? </s>
that question was so profound that we decided to explore the answer of the answer and the si@@ ti@@ fication . </s>
in short , a si@@ de-@@ able is an interactive computer at the size of a coo@@ k@@ ie . </s>
you can move with your hand , you can see each other , you can detect your mo@@ tions , and you have a screen and a func@@ tion@@ er . </s>
more importantly , they &apos;re physical , which is why you can only move them through the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation of hands from the hands of hands . </s>
and the si@@ ti@@ fication are an example of a new generation of tools to manipu@@ late digital data . </s>
and when these tools are becoming more physical and a conscious awareness of their movements , recogni@@ zing each other and percei@@ ving the intri@@ c@@ acy of our gan@@ gs with them , then we can start to explore new and enter@@ taining interaction species . </s>
i start with some simple examples . </s>
this si@@ zz@@ le is con@@ fin@@ ed for the video , and when i &apos;m putting it in one direction , the video will roll forward , and if i put it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards . </s>
and these interactive portraits come true to each other . </s>
so if i put them next to you , that &apos;s what your interest is . </s>
if you &apos;re surrounded by this , you &apos;ll notice it also , and you can get a little nervous . </s>
and they also feel their movement and their pro@@ pen@@ sity as well . </s>
an interesting sequence of the interactions that we were starting to see was that we could apply everyday gest@@ ures to data , how to use colors as to how to do this with flu@@ ids . </s>
in this case , we have con@@ qu@@ ered three si@@ ders as color po@@ ts , and i can use them to cast color in the middle of the middle , where they &apos;re then mix@@ ed up . </s>
if we over@@ take it , we can re@@ cover a little bit . </s>
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or logic games where we give people the ability to see the possibility of quick trial and the result of the results . </s>
here i am -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i series that i &apos;m doing with a simple equ@@ ation program . </s>
this is a game with words , which is a kind of a mix@@ ture of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle . </s>
and basically , every round of ven@@ ue , you get random letters , and you try to make words , they &apos;re going to be tested about a dictionary . </s>
then , after about 30 seconds , again , you get mix@@ ed up , and you &apos;ve got a new letter combination and new opportunities to try . </s>
thank you . </s>
these are some kids who came to the media lab on a trip to the media lab , and i was able to get them to try it , and i took a video of it . </s>
they really loved it . </s>
one more interesting thing about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instru@@ ction . </s>
all you have to say is &quot; form words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do . </s>
here are a couple of people who are testing it . </s>
this is our yo@@ un@@ gest be@@ ast te@@ ster down there on the lower right . </s>
it turned out that he just wanted to st@@ ack the si@@ ts . </s>
so they were just building blocks for him . </s>
this is an interactive anima@@ tive ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und . </s>
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language learning . </s>
this is fe@@ li@@ x . </s>
he can put new characters into the scene by le@@ an@@ ing the ti@@ mel@@ ine of the table that shows this shape . </s>
here he &apos;s going up the sun . </s>
the sun goes up to the sun . </s>
now he &apos;s going to get a tra@@ ctor into the scene . </s>
the orange tra@@ ctor . </s>
good job ! yeah ! </s>
by shake the si@@ ckets and putting them next to each other , he can be able to interact with the characters . </s>
so , his own story . </s>
hello ! </s>
it &apos;s a story of open end , and it can decide how it evol@@ ves . </s>
flying cat . </s>
the last example that i have now time to show you is an music sequen@@ cer sequen@@ cer sequen@@ cer that we &apos;ve recently developed , and in the si@@ zz@@ le as a sound , like leadership , b@@ ass and dru@@ ms . </s>
each one has four different vari@@ ations ; you can choose what you want to use . </s>
and you can put this sound into the sequence that you can put in any pattern in any given pattern . </s>
and you store them by just holding a ton@@ -@@ si@@ ce@@ able to a sequen@@ cing to@@ oth . </s>
there are effects that you can change live , like rever@@ ber@@ ation and filter . </s>
you connect it to a certain clay , and then you en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed it . </s>
and then over@@ weight effects like speed and volume , which you apply to all the sequence of the sequence . </s>
so let &apos;s see . </s>
we &apos;re starting by adding the leader into two sequen@@ cing si@@ ghts and putting them in a series , ex@@ forming them and adding a little more of the voice . </s>
now i &apos;m going to add a b@@ ass . </s>
now i &apos;m going to do a little bit of a dru@@ mmer on it . </s>
and now i &apos;m connecting the fil@@ ters with the dru@@ ms so that i can control the effect of live . </s>
i can acceler@@ ate the whole sequence by turning the speed into one direction or another . </s>
and now i &apos;m going to combine the filter with the b@@ ass , for something more expression . </s>
i can do the sequence as they go down . </s>
and by doing so , i don &apos;t have to plan them in the field , but can impro@@ v@@ ise ; they &apos;d be pro@@ lon@@ ting or wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad . </s>
and finally , i can bl@@ end the whole sequence by appl@@ ying the volume of em@@ bo@@ died si@@ ghts to the left of the left . </s>
thank you . </s>
so as you can see , my exc@@ it@@ ement is to develop new human computer interface , which is better to fit the way our brains and bodies work . </s>
and today i had time to show you a part of this new design world and some of the ways we &apos;re working on what we &apos;re working on in our lab . </s>
the idea that i want to leave you with in the path is that we are on the ver@@ ge of this new generation of adverti@@ se@@ ments to interaction with digital media , which bring information into our world that has the dem@@ ands of dem@@ ands . </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;m looking forward to talking to you all the time . </s>
yes , good afternoon . </s>
and i &apos;m happy to say that i &apos;m there . </s>
yeah , so what should be bio@@ ha@@ cking ? </s>
i don &apos;t have to pick it up a little bit , and that &apos;s really what bio@@ ha@@ cking is doing with the modern molecular biology . </s>
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology and i &apos;ve been doing this for a couple of years now with bio@@ ha@@ ha@@ cking , and that &apos;s what i started to know , because i wanted to know what i was doing , and i wanted to do it in a way that i &apos;d learned in the study of studying theore@@ tically . </s>
so , that was my primary motivation . </s>
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to sort of get closer to the matter , like this . </s>
i think that the molecular biology in general now , generally speaking , biotechn@@ ology , biotechn@@ ology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on . </s>
extremely important is already extremely important , and much more important will become more important in the future . </s>
there are so contro@@ versi@@ al things like these all gene@@ tically engine@@ ered plants on the bran@@ ches . </s>
there &apos;s craig vent@@ er now in the u.s. , trying to make bio@@ fuels , which is called gas@@ ol@@ ine from al@@ ga@@ e . </s>
and among then , there are things that are totally happening in the day that most people aren &apos;t aware of , for example , including wash@@ ing enzy@@ mes that allow us to wash 40 degrees of laun@@ dry , which is also gene@@ tically optimistic enzy@@ mes . </s>
and the list is going to continue end@@ less@@ ly . </s>
and so , from the interest of this technology on this technology , i just kept on going . </s>
so what &apos;s ha@@ cking now ? </s>
most people know this from the software area . </s>
it &apos;s always going to ha@@ ck computers , and then it &apos;s going to be in the media , yes , and the ha@@ ckers will break up somewhere and clear data and so on . </s>
it &apos;s kind of really sad for the ha@@ cker@@ scene , because it &apos;s not true that it &apos;s really true of what it actually started and what &apos;s actually behind it . </s>
and that is that the software ha@@ ckers started out in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s with computer ba@@ st@@ les , and that &apos;s the internet as well . </s>
and it &apos;s about a play@@ ful , creative , original way of solving a problem . </s>
and problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be a framework of what things simpli@@ fy , which is a random problem , and a question of a problem , and how you can do it differently , or how can you do that better . </s>
and it &apos;s just been done with software , but it &apos;s also in the electronics area , and there &apos;s a whole buil@@ der of a buil@@ der scene that you have with electr@@ on@@ onic circu@@ its all kinds of tra@@ pp@@ y things . </s>
and now , just in biology , and i want to take this metaphor from synthetic biology from synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because the d.@@ n@@ .@@ a code is an abstract code that yes , it &apos;s not exactly like computers , because it &apos;s dynamic because it &apos;s dynamic , so it &apos;s real matter , and it &apos;s not just cy@@ ber . </s>
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also code it , and according to it , you can ha@@ ck it up , like that , and i find that incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper into it . </s>
this actually took only two thousand eight really shape , these kinds of networks . </s>
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a dot@@ or@@ g , which is origin@@ ally from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , which is with europe and with a cooperation in india based on the network , but has now been members of members or active people around the world . </s>
that &apos;s a more artistic direction , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosop@@ hers and philosop@@ hers , and working with scientists to deal with these technologies , and ask them to ask questions , and to work creative , there &apos;s museum exhibi@@ tions and yes , anything possible . </s>
but it &apos;s really all about finding such a lo@@ wer@@ ing access to this kind of play@@ ground that has a play@@ ground . </s>
and then there &apos;s do@@ -@@ it-@@ yourself dot or@@ g , meaning i.@@ y@@ .@@ bi@@ o . </s>
this is a network from the u.s. a network , which is actually more like a kind of for@@ um where you &apos;re going to go and discus@@ sed online . </s>
they &apos;re a little bit more technical and also a little bit of business on the road , and then they &apos;re going to ask the questions that are turned on . </s>
and from these networks that made the whole popular part , this is a scene that i &apos;d like to have a scene that i &apos;d like to make for a second time . </s>
here in the picture on the left you see bio@@ corn , which is a ha@@ cking space , so basically a kind of school , a private school , a non-@@ profit facility , where everybody can get there . </s>
kids , old , all sorts of people are going to go just to s@@ ne@@ ak up , and they &apos;ve set up a laboratory and look at what can be done when these lab proto@@ col@@ s do . </s>
the bottom here is a group in indones@@ ia , sing@@ le-@@ of-@@ natural fi@@ le , which is , you know , there &apos;s quite a long time . </s>
even longer than those other two networks . </s>
it also goes into an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , also electronics , and combine that in a very remote way . </s>
a group from ank@@ ara who i had known a while ago , which is a student group who wanted to give the public more to the public what they &apos;re learning in college , and they &apos;ve done so on the street , and they &apos;re trying to explain to people like that , and people are trying to explain what that is . </s>
and i &apos;ve been at the top of the other picture in cop@@ enhagen in cop@@ enhagen in the medical museum with an exhibition to the subject . </s>
and that is that , yes , they &apos;re usually quite young people , but the only thing that &apos;s all together is that this fascin@@ ation with technology . </s>
and what you can do with this , and it &apos;s very specific to the society that you can go and ask , like , ok , what you want to do , you know , have your interest in getting you that way ? </s>
so , o@@ .@@ k now to ha@@ ck biology , you kind of need material . </s>
you need biological materials , of course , and you also need tools , and then this is a laboratory . </s>
or what you normally understand under a laboratory is sort of a broken machines , extremely expensive , extremely distance , just for profession@@ als , trained acade@@ mi@@ cs with ph.@@ d. and so on . </s>
and our approach , in fact , was to say , o@@ .@@ k , you don &apos;t have to do that . </s>
that &apos;s not necessary , because every one of every coffee car has actually been more sophisticated technology than most of the lab &apos;s lab , which is really , really . </s>
and it was o with this pre@@ mis@@ e with this pre@@ mis@@ e with this pre@@ mis@@ e brian de@@ g@@ ger in england , to put a minim@@ um ab@@ u@@ sion , then a ste@@ am of a ste@@ am prin@@ ter , a hot plate , and , yes , such a sou@@ p of sou@@ p , and then , as a result , it has grown bacteria . </s>
so anyone who &apos;s ever been dis@@ played a sou@@ p of sou@@ p that he has left too long has been done before . </s>
i tried this in my lab , and i was trying to expand a little bit , and then i gave myself a little bit of my way to e@@ bay on e@@ bay and did a little bit of meaning analysis , trying to do a pat@@ er@@ nity test , so / that &apos;s so / d.@@ ni@@ .@@ a finger@@ print , again , at home . </s>
now , that shouldn &apos;t be a joke , but it &apos;s not a joke . </s>
so down here in the bottom here , you can see the lab in leadership , so there &apos;s such an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed garage with all kinds of lab dum@@ b that university has per@@ formed , a group in paris that &apos;s going to be there , and pretty successful with it , and also quite interesting things , i just want to cut a project for a second . </s>
and this is bio@@ fuels , which also mentioned ha@@ cker@@ space , this yes , sort of a vol@@ k@@ board school in the principle for molecular biology . </s>
and yeah , so , you see , it &apos;s relatively relative , so there &apos;s some of the people that make it home alone , all the way to large , bigger organizations that are already doing this in the institu@@ tion@@ alized form . </s>
but it &apos;s always always the approach that it should be easy and accessible and accessible . </s>
the first project that we did as an international group , when we were sort of aware of ourselves , o@@ .@@ k , we now have this real scene here , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who always ch@@ at@@ ting and stuff like that . </s>
and then came from do@@ -@@ it-@@ yourself or@@ g website , the fo@@ under website , and i said o@@ .@@ k. , we &apos;ve got to meet now , even real meeting , and then organized two events , one in london , one in london , and just to the united states in the united states , in san francisco . </s>
and , you know , it was also about , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to share with ? what do we want to share ? </s>
so what are our values and what are our values , what is our target , our basis ? </s>
and then we worked out a co@@ de-@@ by-@@ view ct . </s>
this was quite intuitive , so everyone just has his wi@@ sh@@ es , his and what &apos;s moving it , expres@@ sed it , then expres@@ sed it . </s>
and that &apos;s where i think , in my opinion , a very good code . </s>
and that &apos;s not what we do , but that &apos;s right , i think , really well , i think , pretty well , people are quite convinced of this kind of thing . </s>
and we actually tried to get back to the acade@@ mi@@ a world , but there it &apos;s kind of not going to be that way . </s>
so , i think we &apos;re out of bio@@ ha@@ cker@@ y scene , in which it &apos;s actually even a step further than the acade@@ mi@@ a world . </s>
yeah , what kind of projects do we actually do that ? </s>
a project i did with the ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land was that we wanted to make a so-called op@@ tical tra@@ p or an op@@ tical br@@ us@@ ette . </s>
this is when you focus on a laser be@@ am , in one in the room , you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then move on that focus , so that &apos;s where it &apos;s captured , so it &apos;s kind of like a tra@@ gic be@@ am in principle . </s>
this is true , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in acade@@ mi@@ a , and then we &apos;ve thought , o@@ .@@ k , we &apos;re going to get a web@@ c@@ am , and then you have a web@@ c@@ am that scre@@ w up , turn off the lens , turn off the lens , then you have a microscope , which increases around four hundred times . </s>
this is what you see at the bottom . </s>
and then we &apos;d viol@@ ated a plate named burn burn , and then the burning of the laser went out the laser , and then you try to focus on this camera . </s>
and , unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve also learned a lot of it . </s>
so another project that made from the french group there from paris , that &apos;s what has happened , that &apos;s pretty cool . </s>
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s doing , right now , is this one such brain wave measu@@ rement , so e.@@ e. , or something like that , so he &apos;s busy neuro@@ biology with neuro@@ biology , his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck . </s> neuro@@ ha@@ ck . </s>
he then du@@ mp@@ ed this hel@@ met this hel@@ met , and in the cooperation of the museum , that &apos;s where the museum has run . </s>
and then the vis@@ it@@ ors could go into the room , sit down on this chair , set up this hel@@ met . </s>
then their brain@@ waves were measured , and depending on what you &apos;ve thought or how you thought you were , then you have different lights in the room . </s>
it was a pretty f@@ actual project . </s>
another thing from the united states , which also has to do with this father &apos;s population , is the p@@ .@@ c@@ .@@ r , which is the poly@@ mer chain response , complicated word . </s>
so it &apos;s about repli@@ cating gene , allowing you to re@@ produce , that n@@ .@@ a , frag@@ ments of frag@@ ments so that you can make it visible . </s>
so , when i do this , the pro@@ fil@@ ters in the crime , they go down , and they get some hair spec@@ im@@ ens , and then they &apos;re doing this method , and then they can say , o@@ .@@ k , this hair belon@@ gs to this human being , like this . </s>
and the machines that do something like this are pretty expensive to buy commer@@ cially , the che@@ ap@@ est going on at 4@@ ,000 euro@@ s . </s>
and that &apos;s not in the ho@@ b@@ by@@ area , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot . </s>
so this is just one use of a lot that you can do with it . </s>
and the ones that have come up with two buil@@ ders , and they said , o@@ .@@ k. , we make it easier and cheaper , and then you have open source of open source , so free hardware , electronics , you &apos;ve got this device together , and they &apos;re now the che@@ ap@@ ers , and now they &apos;re the che@@ ap@@ est ven@@ gers of these things around the world . </s>
i think kind of like six@@ th of a dollar or something like that . </s>
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s certainly in a frame where it &apos;s going to be a lot more accessible . </s>
so i think it &apos;s a very l@@ um@@ py ha@@ ck ha@@ cking ha@@ ck . </s>
a project i started to do recently was building a gene gun . </s>
gen@@ -@@ gun is , yes , like a kind of an a@@ er@@ ial pi@@ sto@@ l that &apos;s going to take about so far , two centi@@ meters or something . </s>
you charge t. ni@@ .@@ a on gold particles and the gold particles then go into these air press pi@@ cks , and then i shot it on th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ines , and then i got that light on it . </s>
so the device that you see there , it didn &apos;t work . </s>
but this is my prototype , but it &apos;s pretty much looked like this , so on a bran@@ ch , the thing on it , with electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure that was too high , that thing was broken . </s>
and then i took a vio@@ lin , and i put that in there . </s>
a period of time when you make the full of power with water , the enough pressure , so i think , as 40 as 40 , is able to make about it . </s>
and with that , you can acceler@@ ate the particles a lot , and then you can go into the oni@@ on . </s>
and the commercial device costs about five thousand euro@@ s up@@ stream , or something like that , which is about 50 . </s>
so it &apos;s not the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically fe@@ asi@@ ble . </s>
so that &apos;s the moment that the nuclear cause of the scene is just to increase the avail@@ ability of technology and also increase the information and the understanding of the information that more people can get engaged in . </s>
because , as in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a very little idea of it and also no way to make it really well . </s>
because , when you read about it , from secon@@ dar@@ y literature , it &apos;s not the same as if you &apos;ve done it yourself or you &apos;ve seen it . </s>
and i think technology is always going to be more important in our modern societies . </s>
and if an in@@ formed citi@@ zen can also meet meaningful decisions in society in society and want to talk to each other , then you need access to knowledge and technology . </s>
and you have to do it too and understand how to make it and understand it . </s>
and then this takes the head@@ word and citi@@ zen science and citi@@ zen science . </s>
so , as a citi@@ zen , as citizens get engaged in the position of these scientific technologies , as a citi@@ zen of these scientific technologies . </s>
and that &apos;s the cru@@ x of the bio@@ ha@@ ckers . </s>
these are the people who are at least offi@@ cially inv@@ aded the website , ang@@ y@@ .@@ bio-@@ dot@@ -@@ or@@ -@@ or@@ g website . </s>
that &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide . </s>
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also in sou@@ the@@ ast asia . </s>
that is , i think , that they are there are fewer people who are in fact exist . </s>
so i know some of the people who don &apos;t wear themselves . </s>
and this is just the bio@@ hacker , the individual people . </s>
and in part , with these ha@@ cker@@ spaces , they wear these places together . </s>
and that is , in fact , in the beginning . </s>
as i said , two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years ago , it just started . </s>
and ha@@ cking spaces , the computer ha@@ cking spaces , because the c base in berlin was the first one , nin@@ et@@ y-@@ 10@@ th of 10@@ th . </s>
and this is now a gigan@@ tic network of very good , yes , infrastructure centers that are represented all over the world . </s>
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re going to spread the same way as well as well , and then be similar to the fact that there are more people going to be involved with people . </s>
and i would invite every single time to go around and try to do something like this . </s>
it &apos;s not so simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , and there &apos;s enough energy in there , you get there too far . </s>
so thank you for listening . </s>
that &apos;s it . </s>
yes , hi . </s>
how do we actually work people ? </s>
this is a question that drives me very much as a designer , but also in the area of the research , and in front of all sorts of things in the world . </s>
it &apos;s how people encounter people in interactive media media so that they can use this interactive media and make it possible for a better satis@@ fying experience . </s>
because what i believe is that interactive media in us is arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive models , so thinking patterns that have been programm@@ ed in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we just can re@@ generate through interactive media . </s>
and that &apos;s very amazing because you actually believe that this is the high-@@ tech technology that &apos;s going to happen to you , that actually leads you to the future , but in fact , the future is right with us , in our arch@@ a@@ ic roots . </s>
now , what are arch@@ a@@ ic models now ? </s>
i &apos;d written four words four times , and i &apos;d like to explain that briefly . </s>
so arch@@ a@@ ic cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we &apos;ve been able to do in the pre-@@ industrial times . </s>
and in these arch@@ a@@ ic models , we &apos;ve heard that we &apos;re essentially having natural relationship to virtu@@ ality . </s>
now that sounds unusual in principle . </s>
but i &apos;m going to go back to that in a moment , and i &apos;ll show you by trying to prove that you have natural relationship to virtu@@ ality as well . </s>
the second thing is that since due to these arch@@ a@@ ic models , we &apos;re able to speak very , very specific , although we &apos;re using a co@@ di@@ fied language today . </s>
and the third area , which is actually explaining by itself . </s>
we all know that the interactive media of definition is non@@ linear , which includes lin@@ ear@@ ity , and what tells us , of course , that we feel the lin@@ ear@@ ity today as normal . </s>
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information more information . </s>
now , what about virtu@@ ality , which is really the most natural thing in the world . </s>
i &apos;d like to prove that to you . </s>
how many doors does the house in which they live in ? </s>
that &apos;s not going to be a quick answer to me immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s happening right now . </s>
you go through the mind through this house , you live in your house , and look at how many doors are there . </s>
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing . </s>
they virtu@@ alize reality , and it &apos;s all without computers . </s>
fantastic , right ? </s>
and that &apos;s where we have to put ourselves in the media campus , for example , virtual reality reality in our v@@ .@@ r. laboratory , and we can actually do that all the time . </s>
and this ability to virtual the virtual reality that people had needed to do in the pre-@@ industrial times in the pre-@@ industrial times , because they didn &apos;t have anything . </s>
they didn &apos;t have any books . </s>
or they didn &apos;t have any photo@@ graphics . </s>
they didn &apos;t have mass media . </s>
the only thing they had was her head . </s>
and in that mind , the memory was playing . </s>
in this head , knowledge was called , and using these virtual images , the imagination , they &apos;ve been on the road as well . </s>
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with virtu@@ ality so well . </s>
and the interesting thing is , if i can have a little bit of a trip , here &apos;s what &apos;s interesting . </s>
yeah , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on . </s>
what &apos;s interesting about this is that at this point of human beings , media produ@@ cers and medium were themselves . </s>
now , if you &apos;re thinking a little bit more about this . </s>
what are the media today ? </s>
and you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change in change . </s>
but i &apos;ll just talk about that for a second . </s>
essential tools of information medi@@ cin@@ es have been stories since any time . </s>
sha@@ man , pri@@ est , so-called knowledge gu@@ ards , were extra to keep knowledge in stories . </s>
and today , we &apos;re still very , very strong of stories . </s>
the author of the story of the story of the story , jonathan got@@ che@@ des , we &apos;re still continu@@ ing to do a thousand hours every every year with the re@@ cep@@ tac@@ le of stories . </s>
that means for a kid that has been to the achie@@ vement of the grand@@ year &apos;s life most of his life with the re@@ cep@@ tor re@@ cep@@ tac@@ le . </s>
now we think our love of stories depends on us having dinner as a child on the la@@ p of our parents . </s>
no , no , a long way . </s>
it goes a lot further into the cultures of the pre-@@ industrial times . </s>
but for me , in the area of interactive media , most impres@@ sive to me is that we &apos;ve en@@ counter@@ ed by se in our biological memory , the ability to think non@@ linear . </s>
i gave them an example of the north american tri@@ be of no@@ ot@@ ka@@ -@@ indian . </s>
and life lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia . </s>
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very in@@ fl@@ at@@ able area , and you had to navi@@ gate it from island to island to raise food . </s>
and they &apos;ve done this with something called the liver map cards . </s>
you may know that if you &apos;re interested in the austr@@ ali@@ an jud@@ gment of the austr@@ ali@@ an citizens . </s>
they have similar principles . </s>
they don &apos;t have the liver cards , but they &apos;ve been using this bloo@@ dy son@@ g@@ ines , or also gra@@ mp@@ ting . </s>
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navi@@ gation and the topo@@ graphy of regions could be re@@ placed by songs . </s>
where the language was sub@@ mer@@ ged by an under@@ -@@ or@@ dered ran@@ g . </s>
so , you navi@@ gate with sound and about rhyth@@ m . </s>
and these sounds and this rhyth@@ m , the ge@@ ology that indi@@ c@@ ates topo@@ graphy of a region of a region , has also en@@ abled the fact that you could de@@ frag@@ ment those songs and put it in another way , and it could move back to the left , to the right , to the right , and also back to the place . </s>
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from the top of a to b ? </s>
anyway , not to navi@@ gate . </s>
what actually happened ? </s>
that &apos;s the kind of bloo@@ dy machine age . </s>
we &apos;ve previ@@ ously moved what we call the bird age . </s>
what happens is the machine age , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s the photo@@ graphics . </s>
and that is what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and our own production of our individual memories to ex@@ ternal media on ex@@ ternal media . </s>
on the book and the picture . </s>
so , unfortunately , we have god to virtu@@ alize a piece of lost history . </s>
virtu@@ ality has become alien to us , and it has nothing to do with reality . </s>
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at bri@@ gh@@ ton university , has gone so far to say that this mass media , he says the book and the picture , so not the television , the internet , etc . , what we consider as mass media today , that these mass media media re@@ views our memories and our ability to virtu@@ e our ability to virtu@@ e . </s>
let &apos;s make a small inter@@ play . </s>
from the bird age age to the machine age age . </s>
what has influ@@ enced us to our thinking about our thinking and our memory of memory ? </s>
then the fa@@ in@@ tly influ@@ enced influ@@ ences of pre-@@ industrial cultures . </s>
and they have been written more and more over the centuries , more and more , by the influ@@ ences of the machine age . </s>
that is , instead of remember@@ ing individu@@ ally , we have standar@@ di@@ zed , wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad , wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad patterns of memories that we can integra@@ te to our personal memories . </s>
we don &apos;t produce more himself . </s>
we have an abstract language abstract language . </s>
we &apos;re not doing the thing in pictures of pictures anymore , but we &apos;re not doing things anymore in pictures , but we &apos;re co@@ ding our language . </s>
we have used to that things happen to happen linear . </s>
and we &apos;ve accep@@ ted the lin@@ ear@@ ity as a law , and there are only ex@@ ceptions , like , non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity . </s>
what &apos;s left us is the story of the story . </s>
still , we are still very , very highly ar@@ re@@ sted as information medi@@ cation , very strong . </s>
the question is , what &apos;s next ? </s>
we had the vo@@ ws age , we had the machine age , and we &apos;re now descri@@ bing the so-called cyber@@ age . </s>
this sounds very spac@@ y , and it sounds very like science fiction , i know . </s>
but these concepts of cyber@@ age , which bring us these ways back to our ability to re@@ discover our cap@@ abilities . </s>
there it is about virtu@@ ality , it &apos;s about non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , it &apos;s about the story . </s>
let me explain a little bit about that a little bit . </s>
there are technical concepts such as aug@@ mented reality , which means the aug@@ mented reality . </s>
so , if you look at google for example , then this is a concept of what makes us re@@ combine the virtual world with the real world , which is our monkey in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cy to feel virtual as something normal , natural to feel again . </s>
another example is what &apos;s called virtual reality . </s>
so that crazy , of course , in the context of my talk , is that we &apos;re moving physically into not existing , virtual worlds , right after the h@@ olo@@ de@@ cks of the h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st . </s>
and other examples are the ambi@@ ents , smart systems . </s>
these are rooms that can respond to people on a human basis . </s>
all that needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real habitat . </s>
i gradu@@ ated from this , and i hope that the video of the video is a very , very , very beautiful project , and this is the b@@ ach@@ el@@ al work of michael bur@@ k , an@@ n@@ ka@@ thr@@ in kr@@ ence , j@@ is clar@@ ause and jan@@ -@@ mor@@ it@@ z garbage . </s>
and the two last are also here today . </s>
you might be able to stand up for a second , so you can talk to the inter@@ section of the project with the two . </s>
and i brought this project as an example , as an example of how again , this arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive model will be add@@ ressed . </s>
the whole thing is a game , i have to say . </s>
which of course , very counter@@ intuitive , and it &apos;s a computer game . </s>
and if i say computer game , you &apos;re very likely to have people happy to talk about some con@@ sol@@ es , or that they &apos;re playing with some con@@ so@@ le in the hand . </s>
in any case , you can do that . </s>
this is a game for outside . </s>
and that &apos;s conf@@ used to explore the outside world , so i explor@@ ed the real world of the real world . </s>
and this game conne@@ cts the virtual world , so the data of the data space that we produce , with the real world . </s>
i apo@@ logi@@ ze that i have to cut down so much . </s>
you can explain it much better as much more , because there &apos;s more and more of it . </s>
and that &apos;s that i explor@@ ed a city that i see by looking at where places are positive or negative in places where places are positive or negative . </s>
and so i think of the city of the city , a very different kind of impres@@ sion , is that i see negative and positive z@@ ones of a city , and so in this way , a very different virtual map of a very real city . </s>
and now we &apos;re going to look at this . </s>
oh , what you see here , excuse me , is just a little explanation of what you see in the moment . </s>
of course , this virtual world is living in the walls of our cities , so it &apos;s clear . </s>
and with a kind of flash@@ light , we can make these virtual worlds visible . </s>
so , i would like to sum@@ mar@@ ize that , my talk , in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acqui@@ red from the vo@@ cal age of the vo@@ cal age , and that we have a little bit of a sho@@ wer in the machine age that the cy@@ ber age can be activ@@ ated , and that in this way , we &apos;re not in the future of complex , technological , new products , really not into the future , but actually coming back to our roots . </s>
thank you . </s>
yeah , i &apos;m very happy to be able to be with you . </s>
i &apos;ve just been asked whether this s@@ ack is going to be a talking s@@ ack , and i &apos;m going to talk to you . </s>
it &apos;s not going to do it . </s>
i &apos;m also going to dis@@ solve what &apos;s in there . </s>
but i &apos;m just going to give it a little bit more curious . </s>
yes , children are naturally curious or should be curious , designers as well . </s>
i &apos;m an old age of art , so i &apos;m also involved in the issue of curiosity , and how the curiosity changes again , and why we may lose curiosity , and we have to re@@ pel it again , and so on and so on and so on . </s>
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with next to the actual existence of being a form . </s>
when profess@@ ors become curious , they would often be in such a way into the &quot; n research me@@ a@@ do@@ ster . &quot; </s>
and that &apos;s what i had over the last half-@@ year . </s>
a research me@@ a@@ ster on the subject of natural user interface design . </s>
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are the whole cre@@ ators starting to deal with such natural , arch@@ a@@ ic forms of communication , interaction us@@ age and so on . </s>
and that &apos;s where i just come up with one of these little devices because things are meant to become more intuitive , more natural , more user friendly , and there you have to watch , of course , what &apos;s actually for us human beings , what is user friendly or intuitive to us . </s>
and before the background , i &apos;ve been in the field of natural user interface , so the next generation in response to human computers in the relationship of the human computer , how our tools or how the computer is changing from the computer , su@@ k@@ z@@ essi@@ ve to the digital assi@@ stant . </s>
so i was busy looking at when , of course , what is natural or intuitive ? </s>
you might have to have a look at it again . </s>
why does this happen at all ? </s>
so , if we look at the evolution of our society , here &apos;s a short story , we &apos;re now moving from third generation to fourth generation or social form . </s>
so , from modern , the computer society . </s>
every society is shaped by a primary medium . </s>
at the beginning , the tri@@ b@@ al society through language . </s>
that means that you found , by talking a common language , you were able to communicate with each other in the same cave , or in other areas , cities have formed or villages , and that &apos;s what &apos;s created as a tri@@ b@@ al society . </s>
the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very vi@@ vid . </s>
also , you had to learn , so no child can speak of nature , but we &apos;re learning it su@@ c@@ essi@@ ve and propor@@ tion@@ ally . </s>
that was then trig@@ ger@@ ed by the ancient society and the first form of abstra@@ ction . </s>
now , this was a big out@@ cry at the time , because , of course , you started to mani@@ fest language in the form of writing , which means what &apos;s fluid and alive , i &apos;m going to start and turn it into stone and manipu@@ late it as well . </s>
so , depending on how i wei@@ gh it and when i &apos;m car@@ ved , it &apos;s a very different co@@ verage , of course , as if it &apos;s a alive of a life . </s>
but su@@ k@@ z@@ essi@@ ve then moved the script as primary medium medium , got to suit . </s>
and then the next generation of us , where we are now , is still primary . </s>
this is just the pressure and print writing with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others . </s>
at the time , it was as an ap@@ ron@@ t , where sk@@ er@@ us , kl@@ er@@ us and others have said : are you really crazy when the people start reading , then they want to talk about , and that &apos;s , of course , totally fat@@ al . </s>
and now we &apos;re going to move into the next generation and the exciting thing , which is a gener@@ ational shift that &apos;s only every few hundred years and we &apos;re really in this phenomen@@ al phase of this phenomen@@ al period that we &apos;re doing this . </s>
that really conf@@ ers us , because we see on one side of the new media , social social media , facebook us@@ h@@ w and so on . </s>
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what ban@@ ged on the old thinking , doesn &apos;t say that in the read of horse meat and no bee@@ f is more or other phenomen@@ a , i just want to cl@@ ari@@ fy that , and i want to do that , and i want to do that . </s>
and these two worlds are just thinking about each other , new and old thinking . </s>
the exciting thing is , when you look at this , this new society , this computer society , is un@@ le@@ ash@@ ing a lot of mechanis@@ ms , principles and arch@@ a@@ ic thinking patterns from from the tri@@ b@@ al society . </s>
now , no longer at local level , but on a global level . </s>
we understood that the weather is global . </s>
that the theme of ec@@ ology is a global one . </s>
not when i think of local ecolo@@ gi@@ cally , and the neighbor thinks less ecolo@@ gi@@ cally , it doesn &apos;t work any more . </s>
so , from the local village , it &apos;s actually become a global village with the same principles , of course , as well as the absolute transparency , but also total transparency transparency . </s>
as you know in the village at the time , who has something to do with who and when , this is what &apos;s happening today about this expansion of ourselves through these mobile fin@@ dings on the global level . </s>
it is that we know how to do global , and more quickly and more and more and more . </s>
just as it used to happen to the village before , it was happening . </s>
in front of the background , i was looking at what &apos;s actually going on , which is , of course , what &apos;s still going on for us , what &apos;s going to happen to us , but what &apos;s rational for us , so that &apos;s what makes the difference ? </s>
because often , people get to do it , they can &apos;t make use of any user so that anybody can deal with it . </s>
so you have to deal with it , which means that , and not just change it , that it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s going to be better . </s>
and when , of course , something is intuitive , and how i can influence it as a form of influence , and according to the things that they make a user friendly , so they can be more intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun , and they &apos;re just being able to use it . </s>
you go around , you know , also during the study , with the issue of perception and per@@ ceptions of per@@ ceptions . </s>
and that &apos;s , of course , where you start and look at it and say , okay , now i &apos;m going to look inside the inner self . </s>
and how does it look like that ? it &apos;s in there ? </s>
so how do we work when we go in there ? </s>
and what does really mean , intui@@ tively , and how does our chan@@ nels work of perception and how does cognitive processing ? </s>
because steve jobs once said , you need to be able to attract milo to paint how it might be applied to it . </s>
so you really need to look at the details , if i want to make something more us@@ eless or intuitive , what does that mean in the core ? </s>
and what you &apos;ll see is that a a is our seven senses , most of us think that we &apos;ve only seen five , by the way , now , in the near future , there &apos;s still the next , a@@ vid sense of meaning , and as an exten@@ sion , again , again , as a expansion of our self . </s>
and to see how do we process information , how do we t@@ ack@@ le information ? </s>
and by the way , what &apos;s information ? </s>
information is every difference that makes a difference . </s>
many people use the word , but they don &apos;t really know what it means to be detail . </s>
but i have to understand in the core , understand when information becomes information , when it &apos;s going to know from information information , and from information , so i know how to make things intuitive or , of course , man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able . </s>
and , of course , design is affec@@ ting the perception of perception . </s>
we see this , when i shape things , i can make them conf@@ using you on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s sal@@ z and pe@@ pper , or i can sort of make it intuitive by showing things like this . </s>
so , a lot more natural , in a fake , but i &apos;m kind of looking directly at where it is sal@@ z and pe@@ pper . </s>
and when i say to someone , please give me salt or pe@@ pper , then he will look at the right one at the right time , where &apos;s it inside of it ? </s>
and the left is just intuitive , and hopefully i &apos;m hoping that there &apos;s no sugar in it , and it &apos;s just giving the sal@@ ary . </s>
but also our perception of ourselves , how do they dec@@ ei@@ ve us . </s>
for example , this perception in the context . </s>
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , although that &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s just the same size , and yet , our perception changes , depending on what kind of context we put things in . </s>
does anyone know what that is ? </s>
come on . </s>
it should be something that was still working . </s>
it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses . </s>
so , it &apos;s n circle . </s>
a second circle is already beginning to cor@@ relate or associ@@ ate certain simil@@ arity . </s>
and when i go back to a hal@@ f@@ way down , we don &apos;t even see one unit at all , which is circle and circle and circle , but we see one unit , we &apos;re not seeing three pieces , a circle , a circle , another . </s>
this is something called shape law or form psychology psychology , which is also affec@@ ting us in perception of perception . </s>
it &apos;s important for the cre@@ ators , usually in the first se@@ me@@ ster , the great sha@@ ping laws . </s>
form law near@@ by , form law , the law of the continu@@ ity of continu@@ ity and so on . </s>
often , in the third , forget again . </s>
but that &apos;s an essential component , if you really want to make things intuitive as well as possible . </s>
now , the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is seen . </s>
sounds very trivi@@ al , but it &apos;s very exciting when you get engaged in this . </s>
so we have the eyes front , and now you think we &apos;re looking back at the front of the back . </s>
that &apos;s wrong . </s>
you see , first of all , from the back . </s>
that is , they pro@@ j@@ ure an assu@@ mption that they see something that re@@ recogni@@ zes , un@@ prece@@ d@@ ented , un@@ prece@@ d@@ ented . </s>
that means we &apos;re only pro@@ gr@@ essing to see our vision before we see it back in the back of our se@@ at@@ device to say , okay , okay . </s>
so i have this cognitive feedback , which is what you &apos;ve been pro@@ gr@@ essing , what you want to see . </s>
and then that &apos;s there , that &apos;s then coming back . </s>
and then it goes back to the front , because the back of the front doesn &apos;t fall in front of the front and say , &quot; well , you &apos;re just going to look for it again and make sure that what you &apos;re seeing is what you want to see , including what you want to see . &quot; </s> &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually being seen . </s>
so a very , very interesting process of how certain things are going on , and what happens for milli@@ second areas of these things happen . </s>
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s familiar with this image of you . </s>
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described to you . </s>
now , everyone out of this pattern is trying to see something . </s>
i don &apos;t know who recogni@@ zes what is going to happen . </s>
does anyone see some particular thing ? </s>
a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er , exactly . </s>
once i saw that , that there &apos;s a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er in there , you know that . </s>
you &apos;ll never forget it , because i &apos;ll show you where the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er is . </s>
now , you see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er . </s>
and further , now you always see it . </s>
that means that i &apos;ve actually shown you , actually , that you don &apos;t see any patterns in it , but i &apos;ve been doing it within a very short time , and i &apos;ve been able to see this dog again in this ob@@ sc@@ ure image . </s>
and this is this proje@@ ction of vision , re@@ cu@@ lation , to see . </s>
now i know that , and now i &apos;m going to pro@@ pose that i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er . </s>
i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er . </s>
so , very exciting processes , which then in this , yes , gray is actually not , but here in this red crowd , it &apos;s just so far away . </s>
anyone know what three seconds are ? </s>
long , yeah . </s>
that &apos;s our present . </s>
so , it &apos;s also always interesting to know than designers . </s>
if i know , something takes three seconds , until i say , from the present in the past time loop loop , i can also be very good at brid@@ ges , and i &apos;m going to work on somebody with three seconds in the process that i &apos;ve always been working with . </s>
it &apos;s got to work first as a present . </s>
and so it goes into the past , and so i can use very elegant war@@ ning times on the computer , if i know i know this phenomenon . </s>
what &apos;s five to 20 milli@@ seconds ? </s>
yes , milli@@ seconds . </s>
a very interesting phenomenon also . </s>
that &apos;s where you fall in love . </s>
that means , you know , if you know that now , you pay attention to who you &apos;re looking at like a long time , because i don &apos;t take a bar@@ rier for what can happen to you . </s>
and six@@ teen milli@@ seconds , also a very interesting phenomenon . </s>
this is the period of per@@ ceptions that we have . </s>
that means that this first impres@@ sion in a quick speed speed of speed that we see things . </s>
and how we see things that we &apos;re paying attention to , and how we &apos;re , sort of , en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed against our environment so that we can think of it as a very important thing . </s>
of course , the cre@@ ators don &apos;t only deal with the topic of per@@ ceptions and neural process@@ ors or cognitive processes , but pri@@ mar@@ ily , of course , with the subject of human@@ -@@ obje@@ c@@ t-@@ relationship . </s>
so , how a human walks up with certain things is something like this . </s>
there &apos;s a product language of practical functions that can be practical , so for@@ mal , or for@@ mal@@ aes@@ thetic . </s>
there &apos;s excellent functions , where i know exactly where i actually have access to it . </s>
but you also have symbo@@ lic functions , why is somebody like this a little bit of a tat@@ or , where no one does anything in fit , so hor@@ ror su@@ ms of money , even though it &apos;s not that practical ? </s>
that &apos;s where we are more at the symbo@@ lic , at the level level , which we also engage in as a form of nature . </s>
back to my actual topic of natural user interface and the subject , which of course is us@@ eless . </s>
us@@ ability always means how i can achieve a certain amount of dest@@ ination , or how can a user in a certain context can be effective effective , effici@@ ently and satis@@ fac@@ tion to a goal . </s>
this is what it says to be the nor@@ m . </s>
how can i make some use of user friendly ? </s>
i can use it right now , or i need to use it in a man@@ ual , or i need to have a correspon@@ ding training for this . </s>
and less us@@ able or us@@ able friendly is . </s>
that i &apos;m just doing it differently and beautiful doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better hand@@ able . </s>
you also have to understand that . </s>
and if you look at the software in part of the software that we just saw , then you &apos;re also going to understand why nin@@ et@@ y-@@ nine percent of our software today is a little bit more intuitive or not to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ date the i-@@ pad to a lot of areas of areas , although , although it &apos;s already more intuitive than classi@@ cal software . </s>
and so , intuitive user doesn &apos;t just have an element@@ ary economic factor , much more basic success , if i just want to use technology to make people us@@ able . </s>
why ? </s>
because in the rule , we &apos;re usually using this new kind of us@@ ability , which is the natural user of zo@@ o , for example , five times the average of our goal . </s>
you have to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something of the classi@@ cal so@@ f@@ commodi@@ ty , you need five hours , and this new kind of natural software , it &apos;s just an hour of natural software . </s>
that doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s likely to be more likely to go home four hours , but your emplo@@ yer or somebody , or someone , will come up with it for four hours . </s>
but what i want to say is that , for us , it &apos;s a correspon@@ ding performance for us to make certain things as well . </s>
so if we put ourselves in the software of software , here &apos;s the first comm@@ and line inter@@ faces that were very abstract where you needed months to deal with these systems . </s>
and then the next thing that we &apos;ve been working on with ne@@ m neural model and mental model like software e@@ er@@ gon@@ ists have worked , which is that you would have an idea of something that metaphor , the metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top , to make the computer us@@ able . </s>
so no more zer@@ os and ones or cr@@ yp@@ tic code , but a metaphor . </s>
it &apos;s made a lot more user friendly , but it &apos;s also a lot better , of course . </s>
the next generation of graphic user interface spaces have a lot more to do with behavior . </s>
so , as a wall , i think it &apos;s much more common than what it looks like . </s>
this is also a paradigm shift . </s>
that i suddenly think that the appe@@ ar@@ ance is always un@@ important for success , just the us@@ ability of us@@ ability . </s>
and when i go one step further into this natural user inter@@ faces , where i am voice , by language , by touch , by touch , by the gest@@ ure , and no longer by mouse mouse and cur@@ sor , i &apos;m still faster and more inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ous . </s>
but that also leads me to the point , when are things actually more intuitive to be more intuitive ? </s>
if you become more intuitive , and then i have to crimin@@ alize my little friend here and see , what does that mean , because of the view of cogni@@ tion gon@@ om@@ om@@ om@@ y , when is it really intuitive ? </s>
and that &apos;s an intuitive thing for us to do , and that &apos;s a little bit more intuitive for us to think about . </s>
so he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s very easy to do . </s>
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is . </s>
and what does that mean for the designers ? </s>
so , if we look at the fact that we can trans@@ mit existing hands models from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can make my ton@@ gue out as a form of life . </s>
that means i can just trans@@ mit such an intuitive human model model to software , and make the software more user friendly . </s>
now , of course , the question is , what is the most intuitive man@@ ure of us people , and now i &apos;ve already gu@@ essed . </s>
this is called the o@@ u model model . </s>
this is what each of us and o@@ zone is used is an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m and stands for ori@@ entation , selec@@ ting , in@@ formed , trans@@ forming . </s>
it &apos;s doing all of you all the time , but it &apos;s un@@ consciously , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or instin@@ ctively too . </s>
the model is going to be on the wom@@ b and is inter@@ cul@@ tur@@ ally , so it works around young and old , and it &apos;s used all the time , and it &apos;s going to be used all the time , and most of us have known that that model is available . </s>
it &apos;s about 50 , and it &apos;s about 50 to seven thousand times of us ever for activity , so in the sleep , it &apos;s found that it &apos;s actually less often pun@@ ished than a day . </s>
now , i can just ori@@ ent this mental model model , selec@@ ting , in@@ formed , trans@@ fer@@ ring trans@@ action into an interactive system . </s>
and through this kind of trans@@ mission , similar to the metaphor of des@@ k@@ top , but not anymore a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a cra@@ w@@ ling pattern , a man@@ eu@@ vering principle . </s>
and this is on a higher graph of user friend@@ ship than that trans@@ forming a classic metaphor , which is the des@@ k@@ top . </s>
and if i carry that over here , for example , for example , i &apos;m selec@@ ting as an over@@ view , selec@@ ting as choice , in@@ spe@@ cted in the tra@@ p , and it &apos;s big to me , and i can look at it in the details , and yes , it means that i can throw it in the details , and i can just throw it somewhere or shop and buy it , and so on . </s>
and then i can trans@@ mit the whole thing . </s>
i &apos;m trying by an example of an un@@ prece@@ d@@ ented . </s>
now , everybody has e@@ aten ca@@ ke . </s>
over now , i &apos;m interacting with this object , and i can zoom out again , zoom in , zoom in . </s>
i &apos;ll get the whole over@@ view of this whole thing , and i can say , &quot; now , i &apos;m just going to show you all this thing with chocolate . &quot; </s>
and once again , a interface , which is consider@@ ably more intuitive and much more natural . </s>
because i can touch things like my bits , touch , and they come up to me , is much more natural than if in hierarch@@ y of hierarch@@ ically organized websites or other mechanis@@ ms , that can make these things accessible . </s>
imagination is more sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble than particip@@ ating , and with this sentence , i want to close by giving you a clu@@ e , including designers , including designers need to think differently to come up with new solutions , and in that sense , i thank you very much for your attention and please . </s>
i want to help you with a very particular aspect of curiosity . </s>
the first one , when you grow up as a child , is a baby , is that you care about what kind of di@@ vor@@ ce you have , yes ? and whenever your parents allow you to play more or less in your po@@ ckets , the more , the more , you know , , of course , their curiosity , of course , becomes g@@ ad@@ gets . </s>
and the curiosity is not about learning . </s>
that &apos;s why all the ones that are here and curious are people who have a quality that you can &apos;t learn . </s>
so i &apos;m going to talk about basically this whole environmental discussion , world sub@@ mis@@ sions , four years of clu@@ bs of clu@@ bs , in quality , in quality . </s>
and there &apos;s a cent@@ r@@ alized point here . </s>
and it depends on phosphor@@ us . </s>
give pe@@ e a chance . </s>
and every day they &apos;re going to give up + scale to about two gra@@ ms of phosphor@@ us , and every day they have to pick up two gram of phosphor@@ us every day . </s>
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth . </s>
they can &apos;t store energy . </s>
they can &apos;t have bones . </s>
we could only gli@@ de as am@@ or@@ p@@ ly m@@ uni@@ cs through the ocean ocean . </s>
if we don &apos;t actually pick and pass phosphor@@ us on in that way . </s>
ama@@ z@@ ingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re looking at something that &apos;s really self-@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive , but it &apos;s not that way . </s>
because all of the talk about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the phosphor@@ us problem . </s>
the phosphor@@ us issue is much more critical . </s>
we depend on two countries . </s>
we &apos;ve only got phosphor@@ us for two years , and already , through the phosphor@@ us min@@ es world , we have much more ur@@ ani@@ zed ur@@ ani@@ um in the environment than it is used in all nuclear facili@@ ties . </s>
in the last 20 years , five thousand tons of ur@@ an has been distributed to our fields in germany in the last 20 years . </s>
and we &apos;re going to put it all up . </s>
it makes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a among children . </s>
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harm@@ ful . </s>
so , for example , sh@@ y of the environment , fu@@ eling less car . </s>
shake the environment , make less waste . </s>
shake the environment , doesn &apos;t need a lot of energy . </s>
but that &apos;s not protection . </s>
that &apos;s like saying , sh@@ y your child , s@@ ma@@ ck it three times three times five times five times . </s>
that &apos;s just a little bit less destruction . </s>
if we think from the wei@@ r@@ do@@ s to the ba@@ th@@ room , our entire earth will be a ce@@ me@@ tery . </s>
that &apos;s why i want to think about the wei@@ r@@ der . </s>
and the most important thing is to look at the ground , first of all . </s>
there &apos;s over 80 percent of the carbon &apos;s stor@@ ed in the ground . </s>
right now we &apos;re building corn and losing between 11 and 30 kilogra@@ ms of 30 tons per he@@ ct@@ are , or to compu@@ te on the square meter . </s>
that means we &apos;re losing in the soil about five or five times more than re@@ formed . </s>
of course , we can look at the waste problem first . </s>
and everything is pack@@ aging or content . </s>
for example , in open cu@@ bs , it &apos;s 20 percent of the waste in the garbage . </s>
and as we get older , the wind will grow . </s>
they &apos;re like they &apos;re all in the pre-@@ win@@ der phase . </s>
yeah ? </s>
a baby takes about six@@ th of a wind . </s>
we could , of course , reduce this by 10 percent , but what does that do ? </s>
that &apos;s balan@@ ced in china in a second . </s>
that &apos;s completely trivi@@ al . </s>
so the question is , how do we deal with these win@@ ds ? </s>
here &apos;s one of the proof , by the way , that men are not pig@@ s . </s>
let me tell you . </s>
because the phosphor@@ us is given to the pig@@ s about the solid constit@@ u@@ ents of ex@@ cre@@ ments . </s>
in the ur@@ ani@@ um of the ur@@ ine . </s>
yeah . </s>
so , men can &apos;t be pig@@ s . </s>
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s worth , right ? </s>
tradition@@ ally , in the environmental debate , we think we &apos;re too many in the world . </s>
and if you &apos;re telling people that if you tell people to exist , if you say that &apos;s better , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be re@@ fin@@ ed and ho@@ sti@@ le . </s>
and so somebody like al gore , one of our great heroes , is there nothing more important than stabili@@ zing human population . </s>
in israel , if you rescu@@ e a human life , you rescu@@ e the earth . </s>
here it says , the more you surro@@ und , the better . </s>
yeah . </s>
the first question is , are we really too many ? </s>
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , the ants wei@@ gh about four times more than we do . </s>
i could take ter@@ mit@@ es also , but in the united states , no ter@@ mit@@ es like that , even though they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ ari@@ ans . </s>
that means the ants wei@@ gh much more than we do . </s>
and because they &apos;re physically working much harder than us , and because they live only three to six months , they dis@@ agree with their weight , in energy consumption , slightly tri@@ cky billion people . </s>
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ? </s>
and where you see how much we &apos;re going to do , what we really wanted to achieve , and how sad we are that we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that , for example , open up a program , for example , you want to be c@@ man@@ eu@@ tral , yes ? </s>
you can only be c@@ man@@ eu@@ neu@@ tral if you don &apos;t exist , right ? </s>
the only chance . </s>
have you ever seen a c@@ lon@@ eu@@ tr@@ al tree ? </s>
yeah ? </s>
one thing ? </s>
so , our whole intelligence means that we want to be du@@ mber as a trees , right ? </s>
yeah ? </s>
no tree is carb@@ on-@@ neu@@ tral . </s>
lu@@ ck@@ ily not , yes ? </s>
there &apos;s no over@@ population problems in trees . </s>
there &apos;s still six billion trees in the amazon alone . </s>
you &apos;ve heard some of the over@@ population problems of trees that have been heard before ? </s>
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be du@@ mber as a trees . </s>
and where you see , even at something like de@@ meter , the most stri@@ pping bio@@ -- agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow our metaboli@@ c products to go back . </s>
every year we lose so three million tons of phosphor@@ us that really would have to go back in cir@@ cular circu@@ its . </s>
and that &apos;s where we are too many . </s>
just about that . </s>
that is what we feel so guil@@ ty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no organic far@@ ming , no biolumines@@ cence , no natural re@@ gr@@ ance , and how they all mean that our own ex@@ cre@@ ments go back . </s>
isn &apos;t that sad ? </s>
that &apos;s where we are too many . </s>
it &apos;s safe to be less harm@@ ful about oil consumption . </s>
but where are we supposed to be useful ? </s>
we &apos;re trying to mini@@ mi@@ ze our ecolo@@ gical footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that &apos;s useful . </s>
we want to be good for society ; we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the highest thing is not to be there , right ? </s>
nu@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ sions , yes ? </s>
you can only have nuclear mis@@ sions if you &apos;re not there . </s>
if you were to shoot now , you would have emissions . </s>
so you can &apos;t solve that at all . </s>
we can do it differently . </s>
we can re@@ gain our nutri@@ ents . </s>
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil where we re@@ gain the nutri@@ ents . </s>
right now , we can get back to that kind of nutrition in agriculture in agriculture . </s>
we &apos;re going to do that in china , for example , where we &apos;re taking right away from the waste of it . </s>
in china , a cer@@ e@@ op@@ tom@@ ry is still hon@@ oring , so , yes , yes ? </s>
and in our western world we were always too stupid to bring our nutri@@ ents back . </s>
so , the whole western civili@@ za@@ tion-@@ history story is that the city has always taken place , but the farmers never put back to the farmers . </s>
and by doing so , the cities had to grow more and more because the farmers were going into the cities , and the cities had to move further away from their nutri@@ ents . </s>
so all western rich are always expanding until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re im@@ plo@@ d@@ ated . </s>
yeah ? </s>
in china , it was different . </s>
you &apos;ve had a mass of civilization over five thousand years , because you were always able to bring back the nutri@@ ents . </s>
even today , if you invited to dinner in china , you &apos;re expe@@ cting the food you &apos;re going to stay as long as you &apos;re looking for the toilet . </s>
because it &apos;s un@@ friendly to go and take advantage of the nutri@@ ents . </s>
they had them invited her to eat , not to the nutri@@ ent the@@ ft . </s>
that means you can see on the internet how to re@@ gain nutri@@ ents . </s>
and what &apos;s nice about this is that when you do that , you create agriculture , you create bi@@ og@@ as , on a he@@ ct@@ are of land with five thousand people in fa@@ vel@@ as , so you can have a farmer about one-@@ thousand dollars a hundred dollars , and the facility , chi@@ ck@@ ens and pig@@ s and pig@@ s and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and fish . </s>
and the great thing about this is that the cri@@ teri@@ a rate goes back to the fa@@ vel@@ as for over nine percent . </s>
so , we don &apos;t have to control people , not to be bad . </s>
we can support them to be good . </s>
this is , of course , high-@@ tech agriculture , but the facili@@ ties are carrying themselves . </s>
the by@@ product is clean water . </s>
and they &apos;re designed by design that a farmer can just manage them to do . </s>
that means that the crime rates are coming back . </s>
and none of these facili@@ ties , we &apos;ve now built over 100 years in the last 20 years , none of these facili@@ ties have ever been ac@@ cess@@ ed . </s>
they could just blow up a liter of al@@ dead@@ l , and then the plant would be ru@@ ined over years . </s>
doesn &apos;t find any difference . </s>
that is , we don &apos;t need to control people , not to be bad . </s>
we can support them to be good . </s>
that means we need to get out of phosphor@@ us . </s>
and by the way , if you want to do what you want it to do , they write up , in germany , in germany , the best health care system that &apos;s in frank@@ fur@@ t systems . </s>
unfortunately , that &apos;s not in open , but maybe you can help the hill a little bit more like this . </s>
because the frank@@ an@@ id facility could best re@@ gain the phosphor@@ us . </s>
and it has to come back . </s>
we see that phosphor@@ us is really critical . </s>
and we see that it &apos;s going through . </s>
we &apos;ve been using us in h@@ oll@@ and now over three years . </s>
du@@ tch government explained , you &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , what &apos;s going to win phosphor@@ us . </s>
but we need it all the time . </s>
you know , there are two countries that control almost se@@ ven@@ -@@ odd percent of the world &apos;s phosphor@@ us worldwide . </s>
there &apos;s op@@ e@@ c a bunch of or@@ phan@@ ages . </s>
that &apos;s six tw@@ enty countries that control 40 percent of the oil supp@@ lies . </s>
and the oil is going to replace us through other energy sources . </s>
but you &apos;re not going to replace phosphor@@ us . </s>
that &apos;s not about making the existing one a little less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right . </s>
and , first of all , to ask what is the right thing to do . </s>
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency . </s>
in h@@ oll@@ and , of course , you get this easier because in h@@ oll@@ and , the land is built on flowers . </s>
yeah ? </s>
imagine if your wife is sad , for example , if you &apos;ve anno@@ yed you , and you &apos;re coming to 50 ro@@ ses . </s>
it &apos;s completely in@@ efficient . </s>
but very , very effective , yes ? </s>
or take a li@@ p pen . </s>
a woman in germany eating about six com@@ ma three kilogra@@ ms in their lifetime . </s>
doing that . </s>
it &apos;s not that scienti@@ fically correct because , because we don &apos;t know how much away it &apos;s going to be . </s>
but a li@@ p pen , even in that ill@@ um@@ ination , i can tell you , is completely in@@ efficient , but very effective , yes ? </s>
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient . </s>
that &apos;s not exactly resource efficiency , it &apos;s effective efficiency . </s>
asking , what is the right ? </s>
not to burn it a little bit better , and inter@@ f@@ ere with it , and in the burn facility , to lose all the materials for cy@@ cl@@ ing , but first to ask , how do you en@@ sure that ? </s>
think of moz@@ art as well . </s>
yeah ? </s>
when i invite you for dinner and say , yeah , there &apos;s a p@@ ill with open fla@@ vor@@ s and a glass of water to do it . </s>
wonderful , ne ? </s>
this is effici@@ ently . </s>
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient . </s>
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ? </s>
yeah ? </s>
so , everything that coun@@ ts in life is not about saving , to reduce , to reduce . </s>
the whole environmental discussion . </s>
we tell people , &quot; oh yeah , you know , you have no environmental awareness in the south . </s>
no , the thro@@ wa@@ way is exactly the right , yes ? </s>
every place where you thro@@ ws away , from , yes , you create life cap@@ abilities again . </s>
but the wrong thing . </s>
if you throw out the wrong things , you have a waste problem . </s>
as we think from north , we &apos;re thinking . </s>
there &apos;s every foot@@ prints of foot@@ prints . </s>
if you run , yes , each foot@@ print destro@@ ys the floor . </s>
because just the ground is going to die off the mos@@ ses and the wind , and the water , and the water , is going to wash the ground away . </s>
but if you &apos;re in it@@ aly , each foot@@ print means that the water sta@@ ys longer in the me@@ a@@ dow longer . </s>
so , it &apos;s about creating a large footprint that &apos;s going to be a we@@ t@@ lands . </s>
not school management . </s>
we say , germany , sustainability . </s>
yeah ? </s>
but when i ask you , how are you going to do with your wife ? </s>
what do they say ? </s>
sustainable . </s>
i &apos;m saying , thank you , heart , yeah ? </s>
that &apos;s just the minim@@ um . </s>
so , not save , avo@@ i@@ ding , avo@@ i@@ ding . </s>
every waste is nutri@@ ent . </s>
and it &apos;s a l@@ ust when you see in it@@ aly , how the people in the high bow throw it out of the car , so that &apos;s what &apos;s going on . </s>
because , you know , it &apos;s a fun process . </s>
it &apos;s a form of re@@ tri@@ ev@@ al behavior , right ? </s>
you can show , i was there . </s>
but with the right design , here we go . </s>
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed an ice box , for example , that it &apos;s in room with room temperature . </s>
they can throw them away where they go and stand . </s>
in two hours it buil@@ ds down all over the place . </s>
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they contribute through the thro@@ wa@@ way to bio@@ diversity . </s>
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harm@@ ful . </s>
so , there &apos;s two cir@@ cular cycles . </s>
of course , it &apos;s not to be com@@ po@@ sti@@ ble . </s>
a television or a wash@@ ing machine , they just use it , they don &apos;t use them . </s>
just the things that make up , like shoes , like bra@@ kes , like writers , they have to be like they &apos;re going into biological systems . </s>
the things that are just being used go in technical systems . </s>
but today , we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems . </s>
yeah ? </s>
for example , the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , yeah ? </s>
very direct advertising , not for the company pu@@ ma per se , but for the fact that they now help this company to succeed these products . </s>
because we don &apos;t make the things free . </s>
yeah ? </s>
so , when i invite you to eat and say , that &apos;s free from cro@@ w@@ ning , then you don &apos;t help you . </s>
no , we find out what &apos;s inside . </s>
positive . </s>
so not like de@@ to@@ x . </s>
not po@@ is@@ on@@ ous . </s>
but everything that &apos;s in there is useful . </s>
these are the first shoes that they can put on the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an start on the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an , and the rub@@ ber can go in biological cycles , right ? </s>
all of that is com@@ po@@ cious of it . </s>
and if we can do that , of course , we can do that for adi@@ ans , for ni@@ ke , for hen@@ k and mau@@ ri@@ tz and all the tex@@ tile industry . </s>
and that &apos;s half the world &apos;s water problems worldwide that are caused by the tex@@ tile industry . </s>
that &apos;s why they help , ask questions for the people . </s>
hey , pu@@ ma , do you really get serious ? </s>
because they &apos;ve already changed the cha@@ irs now to the cha@@ irs . </s>
and i &apos;m not sure they &apos;re really going to go there . </s>
so , help me a little bit of this . </s>
but it &apos;s going on . </s>
yeah . </s>
that &apos;s what &apos;s just been shown . </s>
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . </s>
we can do things now that when they leave , when they break , they can go into biological circu@@ it@@ ry . </s>
technical am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ces are the same way . </s>
there &apos;s a direct back system for this . </s>
this is the first ecolo@@ gical back@@ pack , actually , who &apos;s made to go back into the loop . </s>
also that , so in any store , you can get the things back . </s>
if you come on that , yes ? </s>
do you remember the win@@ dy again ? </s>
when it &apos;s right now , the garbage is garbage . </s>
all right , these wind up all over the place , almost . </s>
in the countries where people get to money . </s>
there we are in the de@@ po@@ nia , but also in the landscape , right ? </s>
if we change the plasti@@ cs so that it can go in biological systems , if we can change the water stor@@ age , inside that they can only go back to cell@@ u@@ lo@@ si@@ c , then you can plant with a baby in israel in israel , or in tun@@ isi@@ a , hundreds of 15 trees . </s>
yeah ? </s>
and just when they take these pieces , they cho@@ p them down , ster@@ ili@@ zing them , and take the po@@ w@@ der , to plant trees . </s>
this is the baby carbon positive for the whole life of the whole life . </s>
so , we don &apos;t need to be c@@ man@@ eu@@ tral , we can be climate positive . </s>
it &apos;s kind of like a behavior po@@ op . </s>
yes , in a way . </s>
yeah ? </s>
we can do that . </s>
we can rein@@ vent everything else . </s>
i did an institute in it . </s>
now there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and you can get engaged in it . </s>
so , there &apos;s extra to cra@@ p cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le , where everyone can join . </s>
so no longer saving , for@@ ger@@ ed , avoid , reduce , no school management , but smart waste . </s>
does she curious that ? </s>
thank you . </s>
the work of the interpre@@ t . </s>
music as a language . </s>
in the descri@@ ption of my speech , i wrote that i as a interpre@@ ch@@ ess , i think , as a transl@@ ator , in the english vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary . </s>
interpre@@ ts are transl@@ ators of the written notes in clinical music . </s>
that , as transl@@ ator , you don &apos;t just have word word word for words in a different language , but you have to understand the deeper sense of words and word of word , so that it makes a meaningful trans@@ lation , everybody knows how to do it with foreign languages . </s>
now , from the ger@@ man@@ s to translate into english , it can require more knowledge , even when it comes to poetry , when it comes to poetry , it &apos;s going to go around poetry . </s>
it &apos;s a very foreign thing for la@@ y@@ ering , what we &apos;re talking about , what we &apos;re talking about . </s>
as a interpre@@ t of a piece of music , i first have the written notes . </s>
they make sure that the com@@ position in the notes has written everything in the notes , which he imagined . </s>
in fact , the gra@@ des are very va@@ gue and ir@@ redu@@ ci@@ ble . </s>
these gra@@ des are about exactly the same or ir@@ precisely , as a verb@@ al , as a very seem@@ ingly com@@ pen@@ e@@ ous , descri@@ ption of a landscape . </s>
because in this verb@@ al landscape of landscape , the fra@@ gr@@ ance of flowers is not sm@@ elling , the degree of fo@@ unding the fo@@ under of the green , not to listen to the win@@ ds of the wind . </s>
that means that the interpre@@ t has to translate these da@@ zz@@ les of not@@ ations into another , which is audi@@ ble , concrete , non@@ verb@@ al music language . </s>
today i want to leave you with what i else talk about , which is interpre@@ ting , again , into a verb@@ al language . </s>
so basically , a trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation . </s>
that &apos;s why i prefer to do the whole thing in german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equal to me in trans@@ lation to trans@@ lation the trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation . </s>
so , the music works kind of like the spoken language of the spoken language . </s>
these not@@ ated notes have the function of the letters of a script . </s>
so it &apos;s not enough to learn just to read gra@@ des and press the keys on the piano or the right place on a vio@@ lin string . </s>
because that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to draw . </s>
the letters of the letters recogni@@ zes , first of all , if you can do the language . </s>
so , for the learning process of music language , you need at least as long as the spoken language . </s>
now , there &apos;s also de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , whether you learn it for the exercise , only passi@@ vely , or you can talk ac@@ tively , to the musical native language . </s>
the work of the interpre@@ t begins similar to the kind of theater director . </s>
after you start to play a piece out of it , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to research for the beginning of the com@@ position of the com@@ position of the com@@ position . </s>
you collect information about the piece in the secon@@ dar@@ y literature . </s>
you read in the letters , you read them , you notes notes , or whether it &apos;s words about the com@@ pos@@ er of com@@ pos@@ er . </s>
you &apos;re studying the works he was com@@ posed of before and after . </s>
you do compare to it . </s>
the mo@@ des of writing it . </s>
how and what did he feel ? </s>
how were its circumstances , like the society and the politics ? </s>
that &apos;s all interested in me . </s>
you think in that time , for example , by looking at contemporary images or reading literature . </s>
but over time , you &apos;ve been interpre@@ ting a ri@@ gor@@ ous knowledge of the com@@ pos@@ ers that you play a@@ wa@@ ken@@ ess , and you &apos;re getting more and easier to think inside of it . </s>
the com@@ position is becoming more and more to the friend that you live with . </s>
his cause to write the piece is getting more and more and more to my personal cause to play it . </s>
now , as the notes are everything other than an accurate record of the com@@ pos@@ er of com@@ pos@@ er , but just a sc@@ aff@@ old , i &apos;m now going to turn this sc@@ aff@@ old into this framework to bring it back with purpose and meaning . </s>
i then say to my own words , which could be written between that sc@@ aff@@ old . </s>
i &apos;ll explain what this sounds like to mean what this sounds like . </s>
now for me and for the com@@ pos@@ ers , and what you might mean for him today . </s>
every sound , every phrase gets a sense because i feel it &apos;s because i feel , because it &apos;s my personal personal life . </s>
it &apos;s got to be consi@@ stent for me here and now , otherwise i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my cause . </s>
it &apos;s always a very happy conc@@ ert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been doing as long as i was antici@@ p@@ ating , as long as i can imagine . </s>
how to re@@ experience a happy new day , although always with the same ritu@@ als of life , up , break@@ fast , to work on work , as well as i do , i do the same piece over and over again . </s>
i grew up with a day of age , changing seas@@ ons , my pul@@ se goes slo@@ wer at night than in the morning , in a conc@@ ert hall , it takes more longer than the sound of sound back home . </s>
i &apos;m going to take the breath of the audience , consciously , or un@@ consciously . </s>
all of this impac@@ ts me , and all this impac@@ ts my experience of com@@ position . </s>
and so wonderful , if i &apos;m standing up with a du@@ o partner on the stage , and we have the same wa@@ vel@@ ength . </s>
then the same thing happens in a good , deli@@ ght@@ ful conversation . </s>
you bring a new idea into it , and inst@@ antly it will answer the response . </s>
it &apos;s exciting because things happen , because things don &apos;t happen , and what you can &apos;t get samples like that . </s>
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and as the audience , you &apos;ve seen how the music communic@@ ates alive . </s>
so each conc@@ ert is another conc@@ ert . </s>
i &apos;m never going to play the way that we are in that moment . </s>
i can &apos;t play this no@@ is@@ y today in 20 years . </s>
and that &apos;s where i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today and i &apos;m going to have a much more color on my pal@@ ette of music , a lot more color nu@@ ances , emotions and emotions than today . </s>
and sure enough , i &apos;ll give some color po@@ ts out of color , but i &apos;ll get new ones for it . </s>
have a nice specific example of this . </s>
it was on a piano tour of music students in my belo@@ ved old teacher , professor j@@ belt u@@ de , a famous bee@@ tho@@ ven@@ -@@ speci@@ alist , conc@@ ert pian@@ ist and lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty professor of music high school here in stu@@ ff@@ y . </s>
unfortunately , i was still too young , so he was already more emer@@ gent when i finally started studying . </s>
but i was very lucky to meet him very early , at three to 10 years old , and so i was on my cour@@ ses at a time . </s>
i was 17 when i was in the back of one of his cour@@ ses , and i played the last bar of the four bal@@ la@@ ds of ch@@ op@@ in , a night station . </s>
he asked me what was the introdu@@ ction of this bal@@ la@@ d to me . </s>
that &apos;s a tra@@ gic part of a conta@@ gi@@ ous part . </s>
and i was saying , in my you@@ th , an expec@@ tation . </s>
and he was cru@@ m@@ bling and he was like , &quot; so ? </s>
that must be the age of aging . </s>
because for me , it &apos;s memory . </s>
he &apos;s been over six@@ t@@ y-@@ three . </s>
well , with se@@ vent@@ h , you still have dreams , but not major memories . </s>
i play this piece today for every couple of years , and it &apos;s changed for me , although not a single note changed . </s>
it &apos;s exciting every time , because every time i read it , i &apos;ll read something new . </s>
an example of it from a very different area . mon@@ et has painted the se@@ ero@@ sen x . </s>
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at different times , in different light . </s>
he has trans@@ fer@@ red the se@@ ero@@ sis , as he saw her , just as they were doing at this moment in the moment . </s>
his personal impres@@ sions of the se@@ ero@@ sen . </s>
the x-@@ unique interpretation of a piece is compar@@ able . </s>
by now , i &apos;ve become more than ch@@ op@@ in at the age of two , two and three years old , when he was writing this piece . </s>
he had lived only nine and thir@@ d@@ y-@@ three years . </s>
and it &apos;s important to me to look back at notes , even though i &apos;m talking about memor@@ i@@ zing it . </s>
in order to keep t@@ ing@@ l , right with the com@@ pos@@ er . </s>
because the notes are the only connection right to him . </s>
especially if he had died before . </s>
now how do you start talking to the language of music ? </s>
i mean , you know , you need to take about the spoken word of spoken word for the spoken word . </s>
often the music class is so that you learn to read the notes . </s>
you learn to read first before you just speak one word . </s>
you learn to find the sound of the notes on the instrument . </s>
if you &apos;re all fingers in time and just like it is in the notes , it &apos;s going to come out of the sounds that sound together like music . </s>
when that error is free , the student gets the next hard piece on it . </s>
so interpretation of interpretation is not talked to you in the first place . </s>
all right , there it is in the front of pre@@ st@@ o , this is a fast piece . </s>
len@@ to , slowly . </s>
no@@ wa@@ days , f and b , etc . </s>
that &apos;s what most people know . </s>
but also , when you put them on , there &apos;s still a little bit more technical . </s>
and yet , it &apos;s still not interpretation . </s>
i wonder what i &apos;m doing . </s>
i wonder that a lot of times , you &apos;re going to forget something very fundamental . </s>
that , to make music on the instrument , that would do your musical doing and feel like that before . </s>
that &apos;s the singing . </s>
a child who has not learned the singing , because it didn &apos;t have the parents pre@@ fer@@ red , it will not be done by itself . </s>
that &apos;s like learning . </s>
it &apos;s necessary to have your own experience and idea of music , and then it &apos;s another way of an opportunity to sound about an instrument . </s>
people who never funded have never felt inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously with their own body as it is to form a sound . </s>
a phrase with your own breath with your own breath . </s>
because the musical not@@ ation is the exten@@ sion of our bodies . </s>
our vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds to sing , our hands and feet to dance . </s>
so the ham@@ heads in the piano are the sequ@@ el of my fingers . </s>
the tun@@ e comes from the healthy and the rhyth@@ m from the dance . </s>
the contin@@ ual report today with music is not pro@@ ven to be pro@@ mot@@ ed . </s> . </s> &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
you don &apos;t need to make music yourself if it &apos;s getting bor@@ ed . </s>
no more required to whist@@ le or sing a love . </s>
every single music will be plat@@ u@@ bed when you constantly su@@ ck out of the outside with music . </s>
and sure enough , there are some among you who say , yes , but what if i can &apos;t sing yet ? </s>
i &apos;m saying , &quot; you can &apos;t sing , &quot; because they believe they can &apos;t sing ? </s>
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ? </s>
in either , it &apos;s not too late to find out whether or not they can &apos;t , or learn how to use these little muscles that are using the vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ k , right . </s>
because you can train that . </s>
or c , because you &apos;ve agreed to them that they &apos;re un@@ ta@@ pped . </s>
so , i ask , how much compe@@ tent was that diagno@@ sis ? </s>
have you taken a second or third opinion , how do you say it today ? </s>
or d , you don &apos;t like to have music and want to do ni@@ x as well . </s>
but what i would say , though , is that music is a beautiful , communic@@ ative thing . </s>
but maybe you can also agree with them as well . </s>
well , you see , all of the cases , no one has to be a memor@@ able candi@@ date . </s>
but don &apos;t tell me , i don &apos;t understand anything about classi@@ cal music . </s>
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad . </s>
and i say , &quot; but surely you can say whether or not you like it . &quot; </s>
because i don &apos;t think it says , i don &apos;t know if i can taste it because i can &apos;t cook . </s>
so , they don &apos;t really get to eat the food , just because they can &apos;t cook . </s>
so you don &apos;t have to put in classi@@ cal music because they don &apos;t play an instrument . </s>
listen to consciously and tell if it ta@@ stes to you or not . </s>
whether the music is too cr@@ us@@ hed or too sweet . </s>
tell what you &apos;re feeling . </s>
over time , they also get cla@@ ims , and they want to have something that ur@@ ges , or taste , even fine differences . </s>
why am i head@@ ing now from my audience that it &apos;s also ac@@ tively listening ? </s>
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate there . </s>
it &apos;s an art work that you never look at , doesn &apos;t have any force to work . </s>
the food that was written by a chef or a chef has had to be e@@ aten , and not just looking , or re@@ fin@@ ed , or re@@ cep@@ tive . </s>
so listen , please , if a music is played . </s>
she &apos;s not just a nice no@@ is@@ y pe@@ te . </s>
if in an environment where the adults are active music , or at least ac@@ com@@ mo@@ date music , it &apos;s quite easy for a music teacher to ask , what color does your flower have ? </s>
can you play it in blue now ? </s>
and the child is playing , after a memor@@ ial , instead of having a blue flower before , a red flower . </s>
and this sounds very different from the way . </s>
so , that was the very first beginning of a musical expression . </s>
so the first step in interpretation . </s>
and what happens if you played a piece today that was origin@@ ally written as a hundred hundred or a hundred hundred years ago ? </s>
mean@@ while , instruments have pro@@ gr@@ essed . </s>
there was no piano at the time as an instrument . </s>
it was just not invented . </s>
i think the b@@ ach would have been enthusi@@ a@@ stic if he had the obvious opportunities of the modern modern val@@ ves today . </s>
i can speak today the sound that the b@@ ach has had to sound on the modern wing of modern wings , which is a b@@ aro@@ que c@@ em@@ bal@@ o . </s>
also , by bee@@ tho@@ ven , he knows that he was hearing more than he had already been dea@@ f . </s>
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that an orchestra from then has been un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed as un@@ play@@ ful . </s>
so the com@@ pos@@ ers on us are pointed out to rein@@ vent the pieces that the pieces are rein@@ venting themselves again . </s>
so they &apos;re going to be hearing hearing , which is what they just imagined in the mind . </s>
and also , what you would think of yourself in the mind today . </s>
or what i &apos;m pro@@ posing today , because what you might be thinking about . </s>
thank you . </s>
do you know what ten@@ d is ? </s>
have you ever been nei@@ dis@@ ch ? </s>
and how did that feel ? </s>
su@@ ck . </s>
i have a friend , he drives a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i . </s>
and when i come along with my little bit of ro@@ es@@ el , and i &apos;m going to see myself , this is the feeling of this feeling . </s>
i &apos;m going to take a little bit through my head . </s>
i say , &quot; du@@ f , what do you need to do with a big car ? &quot; </s>
it &apos;s been lost half of his value for the first year . </s>
and even , you know , you &apos;re working much less than i do . </s>
why do i have to afford such a car car ? </s>
and then inst@@ antly dro@@ ps to me , that &apos;s un@@ fair . </s>
it &apos;s against the justice . </s>
and as i say the word justice , this un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling is gone . </s>
our organism invented a great method for making such un@@ pleas@@ ant feelings as close to disappe@@ aring . </s>
you can also try and do that with words like ra@@ ge or profit or something like that . </s>
i want to explain to you today something about this mechanism , or something that is un@@ consciously likely to be familiar with you . </s>
the mechanism comes out of the lie . </s>
but don &apos;t think about the lie as you may have heard when people say no one &apos;s inten@@ tion to make a wall . </s>
and then st@@ ops st@@ ops so that he for@@ gets you the point of view . </s>
on a lie like that , you can see that the li@@ ars itself don &apos;t believe what he says . </s>
it &apos;s very easy to see that it &apos;s very different in terms of it . </s>
it just fa@@ ils you and not itself . </s>
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about has to do with making sure they &apos;re fo@@ ol@@ ing themselves . </s>
they need that li@@ ge to get a li@@ le in order to maintain a self-@@ de@@ ception . </s>
they can get less light , yes , re@@ exam@@ ined , or to collapse . </s>
they need time . </s>
and from that time , an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that you might be familiar with . </s>
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l@@ o pic@@ as@@ so once captured a woman . </s>
and then this woman compla@@ ined , the portrait would not be very similar to you . </s>
pic@@ as@@ so answers , they just wait . </s>
it &apos;s always going to be more similar . </s>
and at this point , if you laugh , you see how important this lie is , and how much time you need to experience something that artists can tell us very well . </s>
because artists have a broken relationship with lying . </s>
the artist shares something with them , and especially this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see when she just looks into the mirror . </s>
the artist shares something like this , which they &apos;re just going to be familiar with , looking at this piece of art and again . </s>
then this un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling , it &apos;s not very similar to you , and it &apos;s always going to be more similar to you . </s>
here you have this mechanism where we can use the gap as a great invention for the stabili@@ zation of our life . </s>
and not just in art , even in the vol@@ c@@ les , in which the myth@@ ology , in stories , appeared again . </s>
you may know this idea of lady who looked at the mirror every morning and asked him , who is the most beautiful in all over the country ? </s>
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one . </s>
behind the seven mountains and so on . </s>
and you also know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty out of this real origin , even the mirror can &apos;t lie out of that true out@@ break . </s>
but we should just be familiar with the fact that one woman can &apos;t tell us that there &apos;s a pretty much more beautiful somewhere else . </s>
this is what we need to understand what we understand under poli@@ cing correc@@ t@@ ness over the course of police correc@@ t@@ ness . </s>
what we need at this point is this gap that keeps us the del@@ u@@ sion of del@@ u@@ sion , without which we can &apos;t live . </s>
we don &apos;t just have the art in art , in man@@ eu@@ vering poetry , but in science , in the science of doing such great lies . </s>
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s bis@@ cho@@ fs &apos; woman &apos;s wife &apos;s story . </s>
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and des@@ cent of people . </s>
that the human being should come off from the ap@@ e , and , yes , there was at least a common ance@@ stor between humans and ap@@ es . </s>
and then she ran her up to her husband and said , &quot; that &apos;s probably not true what charles wrote there . &quot; </s>
human beings should have come from the ap@@ e or a common ance@@ stor . </s>
no , no , it &apos;s not . </s>
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent that people get knowledge of it . </s>
why do we need to prevent people who get knowledge of something when it &apos;s true ? </s>
because without that li@@ lies , we can &apos;t live . </s>
because we &apos;re having this self-@@ de@@ ception , this feeling of being great , of the highest creatures , not from a kind of nature , from such a kind of un@@ predictable , like an organism that &apos;s still there , compar@@ able to a stone , and anything that &apos;s in@@ consi@@ stent to us . </s>
so , we can &apos;t even carry these things out . </s>
we need to prevent people from knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true . </s>
so you can see how slowly this mechanism is going to resol@@ ve itself , and how the tra@@ ces leave it , that will lead to something else than on this great image of ourselves , i want to give you another story . </s>
a particularly beautiful story , i think . </s>
my wife told me it . </s>
she came one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about a student . </s>
an au@@ ti@@ stic student . </s>
she likes to love him because he has a tenden@@ cy to ur@@ ge . </s>
and she asked him , &quot; what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es ? &quot; </s>
and then he says , &quot; well , i &apos;m at the fire@@ men . </s>
and because i &apos;m in fire , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things . </s>
yes , you feel it when you &apos;re heal@@ thi@@ er at this point . there &apos;s something wrong with that . </s>
i have told my wife whenever a human being in a moral justi@@ fication is the word because we should try to replace it through the words of words . </s>
do that once and then you experience the sentence . </s>
although i &apos;m at fire fire , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things . </s>
they feel that this is the real truth behind the arri@@ val . </s>
this is a little bu@@ b , which is not interested in fire@@ li@@ sts . </s>
that &apos;s what &apos;s interested in fire@@ men . </s>
but there &apos;s no one that we can look around where you learn how to make fire . </s>
there &apos;s only the second best , just the fire@@ men . </s>
so he &apos;s signed up . </s>
and you say , you don &apos;t say to his teacher , you know , you like to put fir@@ es in place and you &apos;d be happy when the fire is lo@@ cated afterwards . </s>
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of elimin@@ ating the risks that the other thing can do when they get fire . </s>
here you have this little mechanism . </s>
and so knowing that in the heart of the bu@@ b , it already knew that he was related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that loud . </s>
here you have this cen@@ sor@@ ship between the un@@ conscious and conscious that you can immediately do without the fact that you can do something about it , and the things you know is going to look very different , so that you can make it much better for you and others and other . </s>
and then just these words that we use to re@@ use in the language of poli@@ tically correc@@ tive speech . </s>
we actually know that something else is different . </s>
but we know when we talk about this , the social rati@@ os are very sensitive to the social rati@@ o . </s>
we can &apos;t just do that . </s>
it &apos;s impossible to present things like this in a society that &apos;s supposed to work . </s>
now , i want to show you what we found in my institute . </s>
according to which logic , this self-@@ de@@ ception , the will@@ ing@@ ness , a different reality than the ones that we actually know in the un@@ conscious realize is that it &apos;s val@@ id to spread outside . </s>
i want to give you two , maybe , three examples . </s>
the first example requires what many of you know , and some of you estimate , very few of them don &apos;t need at all . </s>
i mean the soul . </s>
what is the soul ? </s>
the soul is such a mental thing , says roughly lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z . </s>
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not about stop@@ p metaboli@@ c , material nature . </s>
and if you have people who are strong persu@@ asi@@ on , you have a soul , or you can also say that they have been re@@ stra@@ ined by the soul of life , so that &apos;s sort of like the soul that the soul is such a mental framework about you , not from matter , you just out of meat and blood , a little bit more st@@ ressed to the earth , to the earth , for@@ getting , di@@ vor@@ ced , un@@ important , un@@ important , that &apos;s dead . </s>
and from that soul , you think that you kind of like this clou@@ dy nature , in this funny nature , it &apos;s called the anim@@ a , it &apos;s called the lu@@ f@@ ty , the lu@@ f@@ ty , the lu@@ f@@ as . </s>
and if that lu@@ f@@ th@@ ine then po@@ ps over the people , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with spirit , with nature that can only live , right with soul . </s>
and then he can run away just away . </s>
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works . </s>
so it &apos;s supposed to be from the outside to people . </s>
so we &apos;re supposed to perceive it as something that is necessary to be present to our lives . </s>
and if you have that pre@@ mis@@ e in front of you , you understand the logic that we &apos;re experi@@ encing of this happiness through a lie . </s>
because now you can use a three-@@ sentence . </s>
three sentence , you still know from school . </s>
so this is now a three-@@ sentence that describes us a logic . </s>
this is the most difficult part in my talk , by the way . </s>
here you need a logic , but also the will@@ ing@@ ness to lies . </s>
nam@@ ely , lying in such a way that you can just use this logic wrong . </s>
in this three sentence , three sent@@ ences come in . </s>
the first sentence is , you know , you say , there &apos;s no soul . </s>
so the second sentence is , if clear is right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul . </s>
now there &apos;s a third sentence . </s>
i &apos;ve high@@ ligh@@ ted him out here . </s>
a third sentence , which is immediately coming up in people who have a strong sense of a soul of a soul . </s>
they say , who doesn &apos;t have a soul , he &apos;s dead , and he can &apos;t say anything . </s>
and here you can feel it . </s>
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this de@@ ception speech for expression . </s>
you see it immediately . </s>
the first two sent@@ ences , they &apos;re logi@@ cally correct . </s>
because i can claim everything . </s>
the logic doesn &apos;t really matter about reality . </s>
i can tell you , the chan@@ ator is a man . </s>
and if i &apos;m right , the chan@@ ator is a man . </s>
if i &apos;m not right , the chan@@ ator is not a man . </s>
the logic doesn &apos;t make any word about what &apos;s true . </s>
i can claim everything . </s>
but cri@@ tically , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s just right . </s>
so , if you say , there &apos;s no soul . </s>
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul . </s>
these things are logi@@ cally correct . </s>
and now our fa@@ vor of your mind feels right now , and you can do something about it . </s>
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sent@@ ences and pre@@ ten@@ ding that the opposite of the first sentence is already pro@@ ven and pres@@ sed . </s>
because , in fact , we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not . </s>
but with this logic that just uses two sent@@ ences are logical correc@@ tly , and it &apos;s added a third one that looks like it would have something to do with it , so we can save our li@@ en@@ ings . </s>
so , we pre@@ tend that it &apos;s impossible without able to live a soul without a soul . </s>
and we &apos;re very happy about this . </s>
we can continue these things to different examples . </s>
so in the present , we have a very modern example of this , and again , the daily new@@ spa@@ pers . </s>
so you have to think of another philosop@@ hi@@ cal issue , a permanent burning of philosophy , present . </s>
and that has to do with the fact that we &apos;re going back into the fourth 10 century . </s>
there was a schol@@ ar who named jo@@ han@@ nes bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ us , and after that , the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ ian es@@ el was named . </s>
bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ ian es@@ el is a es@@ el that &apos;s made of pure nature . </s>
it doesn &apos;t have that soul . </s>
that &apos;s a natural thing . </s>
and if you place the exactly in the middle of the middle of two equ@@ al-@@ size today , it will be star@@ tered . </s>
because he doesn &apos;t know what today &apos;s pil@@ es to go to first . </s>
so it &apos;s right in the middle of the middle . </s>
that &apos;s how nature introduced us . </s>
so , the same forces that solve the other side of the present are different forces . </s>
there &apos;s nothing happening at all . </s>
and only if you get another example , so when you immediately make it bigger , it doesn &apos;t need reason , you don &apos;t need reason , and you don &apos;t need anything to do it . </s>
automatically , he walks to the right side . </s>
so , if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven by nature , you &apos;re determined by the larger pile that you &apos;re facing immediately , then you quickly have the sense that there &apos;s something like a free will to give you a free will . </s>
and if we &apos;re in the state of frank@@ fur@@ t here , i remember the ma@@ x plan@@ ck institute for brain science . </s>
there &apos;s a schol@@ ar who &apos;s called the wol@@ f sing@@ er , and he says , sometimes , wol@@ f wol@@ f , there &apos;s no freedom . </s>
now we can make the second sentence again and say , if wol@@ f is right , he &apos;s not going to have any freedom . </s>
these sent@@ ences are perfectly logical and correct . </s>
and now , what we can read about every day in the daily newspaper is you find that in this third sentence . </s>
it looks something like this , who doesn &apos;t have any will@@ ing@@ ness , cannot be pulled for its actions and cla@@ ims to responsibility , and therefore , it &apos;s in@@ consi@@ stent . </s>
so again , you have it again . </s>
the first thing you have to do is prove that there &apos;s such a thing as free freedom . </s>
but the logic of de@@ ception allows us to pre@@ tend that the first sentence of pre@@ vent@@ ative is wrong , of course , you would have to take the opposite without evidence . </s>
and now you can just , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this au@@ d@@ ac@@ ity . </s>
for example , if you &apos;re going to meet a person you can tell , you &apos;re not going to have a predi@@ ctor . </s>
and please don &apos;t use the german word for predi@@ ctors ; that &apos;s called prophe@@ t . </s>
you can &apos;t call it a little bit more poli@@ tically again . </s>
say , there &apos;s not a predi@@ ctor . </s>
right now , you &apos;re going to find out that , for example , there &apos;s no evidence , you know , you can &apos;t prove that . </s>
and you &apos;ve got a problem already . </s>
because while you &apos;re busy doing that , you can &apos;t prove that there are no predi@@ cts , the man is very happy . </s>
he &apos;s very happy about that because he &apos;s fo@@ ol@@ ed . </s>
because he has led them on a bar@@ ch@@ et that he doesn &apos;t even stop himself . </s>
because , actually , this guy is not interested in evidence . </s>
he &apos;s just interested in keeping himself out of the need for the need to prove that there are predi@@ ctions . </s>
so , in the kind of change of evidence , they experience the mag@@ ni@@ tude of the lie . </s>
and if you have an opportunity once again to feel that three sentence in other people , do it , because you &apos;re going to make other people happy if you don &apos;t remember your own self-@@ lying . </s>
i thank you for your attention . </s>
yes , good afternoon . </s>
so i allowed , i &apos;ve asked li@@ l@@ ly whether i could mention it . </s>
she &apos;s one of the illu@@ stra@@ tions here of this great event , and he asked me if i wanted to give a talk here and give me my idea . </s>
i have to say honest@@ ly , i managed to say it was hard to talk to me about my idea . </s>
and i might like to think of my in@@ sel@@ si@@ a project that i &apos;m trying to imagine . </s>
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum very , very many ideas . </s>
i &apos;m probably , i &apos;m sure , are the two young girls still , i &apos;m probably hearing about the generation of this bad o@@ ko image , because i &apos;m going to study nine tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ nine tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ four , and i &apos;ve started to study engineering in car@@ d@@ board in car@@ d@@ board , engineering high school , and today , i think , k@@ it , i think k@@ it . </s>
and i was going to beat it to berlin in the mid@@ - &apos; 80s , because i wanted to make renew@@ ables , and i didn &apos;t have that in car@@ d@@ board . </s>
there &apos;s the core research facility in le@@ o@@ pol@@ d@@ sha@@ ops . </s>
that would mean , at that time , all the k@@ f@@ a , the jewish was called k@@ f@@ a . </s>
today &apos;s project project rea@@ ders . </s>
because a good engineer has either built cars or nuclear power plants . </s>
but the do@@ o@@ f@@ es like &apos; n solar pen@@ dul@@ ls , out of which sort of a hundred watts out of the square meter , that was a toy . </s>
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering . </s>
i &apos;m gr@@ ateful for the pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a man that he re@@ habili@@ t@@ ated the word again , because after the mouth , you couldn &apos;t use the word , because everything left was bad . </s>
but that was not the case in the a@@ ward years . </s>
there it was , that there was self-@@ admini@@ stra@@ tive alternative , and one of them was just in clu@@ bs in clu@@ bs , where you had the evil gu@@ ard . </s>
location of the terror@@ ist muscle , but it was called the jun@@ k bul@@ b , and it was done wind and sun , and i started there in the middle of the 80s . </s>
and yes , a lot of what &apos;s been said today is really , because many , many beautiful expres@@ sions were about that i had also lived through . </s>
i &apos;ve worked on collective for 11 years , which was grass@@ roots . </s>
we were 20 people . </s>
when one no@@ de has said , the v@@ et@@ op@@ bee@@ p , which has been totally cru@@ m@@ bling . i &apos;ve been very hard for for 10 years , whether i &apos;m going to have my great engineering study , maybe , because all the employees of my father in my father are always talking to him , you were making the money out of the window in your child . </s>
it &apos;s a s@@ co@@ op . </s>
and this was really , very bit@@ ter , and then you come in such a period of time , and i just showed you a picture of what i &apos;ve been thinking about , where i asked myself about 10 years old , a thousand d mark at the time , of course , in the collective , of course , in collective , of course , if it really should be the great thing . </s>
and i was going to last up to six and nin@@ et@@ y-@@ nine years , and then with friends , i &apos;ve become co-@@ fo@@ under of the company sol@@ on , which then became one of the largest cell@@ -@@ ups in the world with the sp@@ in-@@ off of the world . </s>
a tremendous amount of success , of course , of course , again , is the problem of a growing company , and then we have two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ -@@ six , a small group , decided we &apos;re going to start small and go back and forth the next issue of the future of the future , and that &apos;s the same kind of crazy -- again , it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s going to be crazy again , that people say , what &apos;s the source of the rub@@ bis@@ h , it &apos;s all not , we talk about store . </s>
and i brought to you a project that i &apos;m going to show you now . </s>
and the title of the talk was , yes , how you get to a hundred percent renew@@ able . </s>
and we just started asking with a relatively simpli@@ stic story , where you could , because you &apos;ve got to use a memory today . </s>
on this island , this is the island of gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the a@@ z@@ ors . </s>
yeah , that &apos;s the data . </s>
there are four and a half thousand people living there . </s>
they today have a total renew@@ able rate of 15 percent renew@@ ables today . </s>
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ? </s>
it &apos;s just not technological . </s>
when they grow more wind force , the system starts to fail . </s>
i &apos;m always telling the politicians to the politicians in ber@@ lin@@ ing our facility in ber@@ lin@@ -@@ ad@@ ler@@ d . </s>
they &apos;re always saying , why ? </s>
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany . </s>
can &apos;t be a problem yet . </s>
but not , we have seven percent in europe , and our web is physically seen as the european . </s>
if we had 20 percent in europe , we &apos;ve already had the same problems that people have on this island in this island . </s>
the question was simple , calcul@@ ating that was two thousand in 2006 , and the first cont@@ acts of cont@@ acts with the island was just a little bit through the island . </s>
how big a battery would have to be like a battery so that you could have an island for 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even se@@ vent@@ ly percent renew@@ ables . </s>
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go one more . </s>
the conventional system looks like this all over the world . </s>
by the way , about a hundred gi@@ ga@@ watts of electrical performance are built on the planet basis every year in the world . </s>
this is the achie@@ vement of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it &apos;s very quickly everywhere . </s>
the world &apos;s energy hunger , which is taking place , is going to be del@@ et@@ ed by this , because you don &apos;t need per@@ mission . </s>
this is spee@@ ding up . </s>
you think of it as a box . </s>
and then it looks like this , usually . </s>
and over and over again , three of the no@@ des are always wa@@ ited , two will always be wa@@ ited . </s>
yeah , this is what you see at the bottom is the bur@@ den of the load . </s>
we also got very deta@@ iled data on this . </s>
and the wind power plant or the solar condi@@ tioning , or whatever it is , is usually a back@@ -up system of a back@@ -up system , a system that can only be stor@@ ed in small quanti@@ ties here . </s>
our goal was to just say , okay . </s>
the theme of this is going to be up up and the wind , and the sun is so that they can make the bur@@ den of the larger percentage . </s>
and if they want to go over 20 , 30 percent renew@@ ables , energy per year , they don &apos;t have the performance at the moment , then they have to turn off the oil . </s>
that means , at the moment , you have to care that renew@@ ables can sort of take the entire net . </s>
of course , you can only , if you &apos;re in some way , man@@ eu@@ ver@@ ted here . </s>
it hasn &apos;t been done in the world yet . </s>
that &apos;s in a little style , so you can also serve a little bit in your car in your own car . </s>
people always ask me , what are you doing in ad@@ ler@@ sh@@ in ? </s>
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on . </s>
but if you want to connect multiple of these changing , and you want to build a net , it &apos;s going to be extremely complicated . </s>
and our goal was that we wanted to come down to 70 to nine percent renew@@ ables , and then here &apos;s the rest , the last rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renew@@ able , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re going to make it out of batter@@ ies . </s>
that will definitely be an energy car@@ rier that then , hydrogen , methan@@ e , power to gas , you know , it will be . </s>
then you have to go more to a seas@@ onal memory , and winter summer , and not just the wa@@ g night . </s>
we just wanted to know what &apos;s with a normal , st@@ ressed electro@@ chemical battery . </s>
how far is it going to come from there ? </s>
and then they did a whole bunch of simu@@ lations . </s>
and then wind and sun and the load and the bur@@ den of the load came through the result , a very exciting result , that you have the conventional system of the conventional system , which , after 20 , 20 cents , is about 50 cents per kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t-@@ worth of kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t-@@ hour , it takes about four to four cents a kil@@ o@@ watt . </s>
these were the first first calcu@@ lations six years ago . </s>
and then we said , okay . </s>
well , it &apos;s great , then we have a business model . </s>
we &apos;re cheaper like the dies@@ el system that &apos;s going to increase the price five percent a year . </s>
and then we started negoti@@ ating the insulin lan@@ ders . </s>
what would it have to be done ? </s>
have negoti@@ ated with inve@@ stors , i &apos;ve been looking for new cre@@ ators . </s>
we weren &apos;t then five people back then to re@@ build the society . </s>
and let me show you the picture . </s>
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green is our system . </s>
that our system also has increased a price , and that &apos;s because we &apos;re going to have 20 percent of this , and also a price increase on the other side of the other stuff . </s>
and the power@@ -@@ utili@@ ty , which has the electric supply companies on the island of the island , we find that we find a great deal . </s>
we want to support it , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the engineering problem . </s>
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can sort of map the electrical rati@@ o of the island of one to three precisely . </s>
that is , we first sou@@ ght to find the largest battery in the world . </s>
there she is . </s>
it &apos;s natural from asia , in the case of japan . </s>
and funny , in the &apos; 70s , she had been developing at bb@@ c man@@ n@@ heim , today , and then it was pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly developed and turned out to be the japanese . </s>
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery . </s>
it &apos;s got a mega@@ watt achie@@ vement , and it can take that performance for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we can sort of get out of the simu@@ la@@ tional technology . </s>
and then they set up . </s>
we also have one of these ancient ag@@ gre@@ gate ag@@ gre@@ gate at the same size that he says there , in the hall of the hall , actually the complete dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hall it looks like this , there &apos;s this one , there &apos;s the big battery , here &apos;s the big battery , here &apos;s the whole volume that allows us to simu@@ late the net . </s>
over here , we &apos;re running the whole trans@@ lu@@ lation system , the miles physics of the cable , to sort of map the vibra@@ tional behavior on the web . </s>
and here you can see the whole thing again . </s>
we can also turn on two hundred kil@@ o@@ watts of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics on the web . </s>
here we can see again here , again , on the top , all the way back here , all the individual ag@@ gre@@ gate of ag@@ gre@@ gate . </s>
and what we did , since two thousand nine years , the hal@@ le was finished , until now two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ -@@ dollar , basically everything that &apos;s going on between the individual system of electronics to software software , we made it . </s>
so we &apos;re not a battery manufac@@ tur@@ er , but we &apos;re define as a company that is just between the topic of battery and the topic of the grid and everything in between . </s>
you &apos;ve got to communicate to the battery , of course , and you also have to communicate to the net , and that &apos;s very complicated . </s>
and the beauty of this is that , in this island , you &apos;re basically going to take everything out of this island that we &apos;re going to get when we &apos;re going to get our share of renew@@ ables . </s>
so this whole discussion , as it is right now , is moving and moved , energy turn , how to go , on the island , for example , on the island of five to 30 percent of ex@@ pos@@ ure energy , so we need to have the wind of the wind and the sun . </s>
natural light then offers smart ads . </s>
so smart grid , a huge issue everywhere . </s>
we can start to begin to integra@@ te electro@@ mo@@ bility in the island , to ask people , because the bur@@ den of the bur@@ den , because the bur@@ den of the bur@@ den . </s>
that means if you &apos;re at 70 percent renew@@ able , you &apos;re not going to be able to do that without memory . </s>
you can do through n smart grid , you can build the nets of nets , yes , you should be able to do that in any case , the percentage , but you &apos;re never going to be able to get away from memory . </s>
and that &apos;s the kind of thing that &apos;s the em@@ bas@@ sy &apos;s message . </s>
that &apos;s why a lot of people are coming and look at this , just because you can see what problems you get . </s>
if we turn off the volume , you &apos;re not going to have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass that trig@@ gers a certain in@@ er@@ ti@@ a on the net . </s>
and our european distribution is basically just out of loud ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses of great power plants , where the wave of wave all over europe are always like the wave of europe . </s>
we look into this network , you see the fif@@ ty her@@ tz , and if there &apos;s nine and a half com@@ ma nine her@@ tz , we start to make a few val@@ ves , again , a little bit of mer@@ h ste@@ am in , and then we get up again . </s>
that &apos;s the system . </s>
and of course , that &apos;s incredible a@@ wards . </s>
if you te@@ ar it down somewhere , it takes a long time to go . </s>
the sp@@ are reser@@ ves have at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable . </s>
and in time , they can react again . </s>
if you don &apos;t have that , this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , you need to replace that with your service electronics and electro@@ chemistry . </s>
and we can turn out the big battery of this big battery two milli@@ seconds , two milli@@ seconds . </s>
so , you can see that there &apos;s a tremendous speed of spee@@ ds there . </s>
and the message is , we need to rely on these ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses , if we &apos;re going to t@@ ack@@ le our goals , 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 percent , and so on , if we even want to achieve it at all . </s>
and then we need to re@@ build our mu@@ st-@@ run capacity on the net . </s>
mu@@ st-@@ run is simple , the power plant is running with the frequency of keeping the frequency . </s>
yeah , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , building the coal power plants , because we don &apos;t , or ga@@ ze ga@@ ins , because that &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing . </s>
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can de@@ grade the capacity , the mu@@ st-@@ run capacity , by bringing electro@@ chemical memory into the net as well . </s>
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies now . </s>
and at that point , people are always coming up and looking at our trial at the same time , sort of our in@@ cen@@ ding test . </s>
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far can you take a piece of future there ? </s>
and a lot of discus@@ sions that i &apos;ve had over the last six years were similar to the discussion i &apos;ve had over the last 30 years on photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics . </s>
it &apos;s not , you know , s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wing , child playing stuff , and we &apos;ve done everything , and we &apos;ve never calcul@@ ated it . </s>
we have 30 gi@@ ga@@ watt of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics in germany today . </s>
this is pre-@@ visual . </s>
and i just want to point out that in the next 30 years , we &apos;ll have the same capacity for electro@@ chemical stor@@ ms around the world in the next 30 years . </s>
very simple , this is how it will come . </s>
there &apos;s going to be a whole lot of resilience and a lot of stri@@ kes . </s>
and the nice thing is , i &apos;ve just seen in the last two years that scientists are standing on my side . </s>
we &apos;ve now got over tens of millions of pro@@ projects , including a 10-@@ mega@@ -@@ mega@@ wat@@ t-@@ battery , right now to climb the german network . </s>
this is going to happen in the next april . </s>
so , you know , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s just from this in@@ fer@@ ior to yes , to the idea , a hundred percent renew@@ able right now . </s>
and if you have a hundred percent renew@@ able , it &apos;s like a au@@ al@@ th system . </s>
so far , in discus@@ sions , they &apos;ve always tried , these insulin , they make au@@ tar@@ k , they have a very small net , and they have nothing to do with our verb@@ al ties . </s>
now , the question is very simple , if they &apos;re completely independent of any fossil or a@@ ge-@@ energy energy that &apos;s going to be dri@@ ll@@ ed anywhere in the world and put them into them , then they &apos;re an island . </s>
then they only use what &apos;s there on the sun and wind where they live . </s>
and this is a little bit of our vision of a reason of energy , and i &apos;m gr@@ ateful for cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le as well as being told , using solar energy . </s>
and that &apos;s what we do , and in the process , the talk about the pre@@ mi@@ um of pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a , that you can be a collective , and use solar energy , here &apos;s a little bit of a creature . </s>
and yeah , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little bit crazy and also have a vision . </s>
and you really have to stay pretty tough in that , but i think it &apos;s going to go . </s>
thank you . </s>
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , colum@@ n@@ ist of the los angeles times , one day went through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music . </s>
she came from a man , an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american , sym@@ pa@@ thetic , ra@@ u , hom@@ eless , who played on a vio@@ lin that had only two str@@ ings . </s>

i &apos;m recom@@ men@@ ding you to read ste@@ ek book , or look at the movie so that you can &apos;t only understand the wonderful inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness between these two men , but how the music was helping that link , and how it ended up being the instrument that allowed that word to get na@@ than@@ iel off the street . </s>
i met m@@ r a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt dis@@ ney , hall . </s>
he had just heard a performance by bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth symph@@ ony , and came up behind the stage to imagine . </s>
he was speaking in a very heal@@ er and gre@@ y clay over yo@@ -@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clinton and how the do@@ d@@ gers would never be able to make it in the baseball world series , and all of this because of the t@@ all@@ tale pas@@ sage of the first vio@@ lin in the last sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth symph@@ ony . </s>
we got to talk to music a few days later , and a couple days later , i got an email that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in ma@@ than@@ iel education . </s>
i need to mention that na@@ than@@ iel had reje@@ cted a medical treatment because he had already been treated with electrical sho@@ cks and th@@ or@@ ac@@ ine and hand@@ ou@@ ts , a trau@@ ma to pur@@ sue him his entire life . </s>
so , as a result , he &apos;s now particularly sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble to these schizophren@@ ics , and they &apos;re so bad at times , and he van@@ ish@@ es it disappe@@ ars into the streets of sk@@ id row , always exposed to this hor@@ ror and the tor@@ ture of his own mind . </s>
and in the same way that na@@ than@@ iel was na@@ than@@ iel , na@@ than@@ iel , when we started with our first lesson in the lawyer of dis@@ ney , started hall , he had this ir@@ n@@ our@@ ished fl@@ our@@ ishing in his eyes and it was completely lost . </s>
he talked about invisible demon@@ stra@@ tions and smoke and about how somebody wanted to po@@ ison him in the sle@@ eping . </s>
i was scared , not for sure , but i was afraid that i could lose it , that he could fall in one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship with the vio@@ lin , if i started talking about pit@@ ches and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of the di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic g@@ au@@ pe@@ da@@ k . </s>
so i just started to play . </s>
i was playing the first sentence by bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s vio@@ lin con@@ cer@@ ts . </s>
and while i was playing , i noticed that in na@@ th@@ ani@@ ans , there was a complete change going on . </s>
it was as if he was under the impact of an invisible drug , a chemical reaction whose cat@@ aly@@ st was my game . </s>
na@@ th@@ ani@@ am &apos;s man@@ ic z@@ or@@ n turned into understanding , in a quiet curiosity and desire . </s>
and as a mira@@ cul@@ ous miracle , he took his vio@@ lin and began to play a bunch of viol@@ ations of vio@@ lin con@@ cer@@ ts , and then asked me to finish her : men@@ del@@ s@@ son , t@@ wen@@ i@@ w@@ ski , si@@ be@@ li@@ us . </s>
we started talking about music , starting from b@@ ach talking to bee@@ tho@@ ven , bra@@ h@@ ms , bru@@ ck@@ ner and all the other things from bar@@ to@@ k to es@@ a-@@ pe@@ k@@ ka sal@@ ons . </s>
and i realized he was not just an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ dic knowledge of music , but it &apos;s also a close personal relationship with her . </s>
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i remember just my colleagues in the phil@@ harmon@@ y of los angeles . </s>
by playing music and talking about music was from this par@@ an@@ o@@ id , conf@@ used man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a lo@@ wer@@ ing , educated , educated , educated , trained musi@@ cian in ju@@ illi@@ ard musicians . </s>
music is medicine . music changes us . </s>
for na@@ than@@ iel , music means mental health . </s>
because the music allows him to re@@ form his thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions with the help of his imagination and creativity into something real . </s>
and this is how he es@@ cap@@ es its ag@@ oni@@ zing states . </s>
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art . </s>
this is why we &apos;re making music : so that we have something that inside of us is deep inside of us , our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , through our creativity . </s>
and the reality of the expression hit us all of us , and move , inspired , inspire us . </s>
what na@@ than@@ iel did , he brought his music back into a community of friends . </s>
the re@@ lief force of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood his talent and recognized his talent and took him . </s>
and i &apos;m going to talk to na@@ than@@ iel again , whether in a lawyer &apos;s dis@@ ney , hall or in sk@@ id row , because he re@@ minds me of why i became a musi@@ cian . </s>
thank you . </s>
brun@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you very much . thank you . </s>
robert gu@@ p@@ ta . </s>
robert gu@@ p@@ ta : i want to play a little bit that i don &apos;t give you the c@@ elli@@ st of the c@@ elli@@ st . </s>
i hope you &apos;ll for@@ give me . </s>
so in my life , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life . </s>
i only loved two . </s>
this first , that was more like a passionate monkey . </s>
it was a beautiful fish , very deli@@ cious , good consi@@ sten@@ cy , dur@@ able , one of the best s@@ eller on the men@@ u . </s>
what a fish . </s>
even better , he was raised in aqu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture after the highest standards of sustainability . </s>
so you could feel , you know , sell it . </s>
i had a relationship with this beauty over a couple of months . </s>
one day , the director of the company was calling , and asked if i could carry on a session on the sustainability of the farm . </s>
&quot; of course , &quot; i said . </s>
here was a company trying to solve what had become the uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem for our che@@ fs . how do we keep fish on our men@@ u ? </s>
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fis@@ hed the oceans as we &apos;ve be@@ aten forests . </s>
it &apos;s hard to over@@ grade the destruction . </s>
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the heal@@ ing bu@@ ll@@ s , the sal@@ mon fish , they have collap@@ sed . they have collap@@ sed . </s>
there &apos;s almost nothing left to do . </s>
so , it &apos;s likely to be , or che@@ ap@@ ly , the fis@@ hes , a fis@@ sion , a part of our future . </s>
a lot of arguments against it . fishing facili@@ ties , most of you , anyway , and you &apos;re in@@ efficient , you &apos;re going to take tuna , you &apos;re going to have a big dis@@ advantage . </s>
it &apos;s got 15 to one food feeding . </s>
so , 15 pounds of wild@@ life are needed to get a pound tun@@ e in the tuna . </s>
not very sustainable . </s>
it doesn &apos;t taste very well . </s>
so , finally , there was a company that was trying to do it right now . </s>
i wanted to support them . </s>
the day before the event , i called the public public &apos;s head for the company . </s>
we don &apos;t call it . </s>
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts right , you &apos;re famous for building as far out in the sea , that you don &apos;t cont@@ amin@@ ate the environment . &quot; </s>
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish is not concentr@@ ated . &quot; </s>
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a different world . </s>
this feed of 2.@@ 5 to one , he said , &quot; he said . </s>
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot; </s>
2.@@ 5 to one , great . </s>
&quot; 2.@@ 5 to one thing ? what are you feeding ? &quot; </s>
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said . </s>
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on . </s>
and that evening i was lying in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ? </s>
so , the next day i called , just before the event , don &apos;t . </s>
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , for example , sustainable proteins ? &quot; </s>
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to be asked . </s>
now , i was working with a couple of people in the company . no one could give me a proper answer , until finally , i was working with the gui@@ dance biologists . </s>
we also don &apos;t call him a don . </s>
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot; </s>
well he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ e and some fishing me@@ als , and then he said , chicken pel@@ lets . </s>
i said , &quot; chicken pel@@ lets ? &quot; </s>
he said , &quot; yes , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , bone fl@@ our , c@@ ran@@ e , dri@@ ed and feed food . &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; well , what percentage of your fu@@ ck is chicken ? &quot; </s>
maybe two percent in the assu@@ mption of maybe two percent . </s>
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said . </s>
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you , what &apos;s sustainable to have chicken in fish ? &quot; </s>
there was a long break in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot; </s>
i fell in love with that fish . </s>
no , not because i &apos;m a confi@@ dent enjo@@ yer and gu@@ tt@@ man . </s>
i actually am . </s>
no , i actually loved it from this fish because , because i swe@@ ar to god , the fish after this conversation , after this conversation . </s>
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love story . </s>
it &apos;s the romantic art , the way you learn your fish , the more you love your fish , you love the fish . </s>
i first e@@ aten it in a restaurant in southern spa@@ in . </s>
a friend of mine had been talking about this fish for a long time . </s>
it &apos;s kind of wired us . </s>
he came up to the table with a bright , almost sh@@ ining white color . </s>
the chef had it coo@@ ked up . </s>
wait a minute . </s>
ama@@ z@@ ingly , he was still deli@@ cious . </s>
who can taste a fish so well after he got coo@@ ked ? </s>
i can &apos;t , but this guy can . </s>
let &apos;s call it mi@@ gu@@ el . in fact , he &apos;s called mi@@ gu@@ el . </s>
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least in the way that she and i understand . </s>
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma . </s>
this is a fish elev@@ ated in the sou@@ th@@ west corner of spa@@ in . </s>
she &apos;s near the mou@@ ths of the river gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r . </s>
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of ar@@ gent@@ ina . </s>
they raised meat c@@ attle on what was essentially we@@ t@@ lands . </s>
they did it by selec@@ ting the land of the land . </s>
they built this complicated series of chan@@ nels , and they push water out of the country and out into the river . </s>
well , they couldn &apos;t make the difference , not econom@@ ically . </s>
and ecolo@@ gi@@ cally , it was a disaster . </s>
it brought about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds for this place . </s>
and so in 198@@ 2 , a span@@ ish company , in the environment , bought the land of green consciousness . </s>
what did they do ? </s>
they have conver@@ ted the flow of water . </s>
they literally surrounded the le@@ ver . </s>
instead of pushing the water out , they used the chan@@ nels to pull the water back again . </s>
they f@@ loo@@ ded the chan@@ nels . </s>
they created a 1@@ 1,000 he@@ c@@ tar@@ es of fish -- bar@@ k , se@@ als , shrimp , a@@ al -- and with mi@@ gu@@ el , mi@@ gu@@ el and his company , the ecolo@@ gical destruction completely vice ver@@ sa . </s>
the farm is incredible . </s>
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this . </s>
they &apos;re star@@ ing out on the hori@@ zon , which is a million miles away , and all you &apos;re seeing is flo@@ wing chan@@ nels and this density , l@@ umin@@ ous march . </s>
i wasn &apos;t a long time ago with mi@@ gu@@ el . </s>
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and part of &quot; a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le to k@@ is@@ sing . &quot; </s>
okay ? there we were , f@@ ought us through the we@@ t@@ lands and i s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ed and swe@@ at , got ma@@ ts@@ a to my k@@ ne@@ es , and mi@@ gu@@ el keeps a biology lecture in quiet . </s>
this is where he pi@@ cks up a rare ra@@ il@@ way . </s>
now he mentioned the miner@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton . </s>
and here , he sees a pattern of b@@ und@@ les , which re@@ minds him of the tanz@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ffe . </s>
and it turns out that mi@@ gu@@ el spent most of his career in the mi@@ wish national national park in africa . </s>
i asked him how he became such a fish experts . </s>
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish . </s>
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot; </s>
and then it goes , and it goes into more and more talked about rare birds and al@@ ga@@ e and weird water plants . </s>
and don &apos;t get me wrong , this was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community , in the way , in the way this way . </s>
it &apos;s great , but i was in love . </s>
and my head was fa@@ ther@@ ed to this broken piece of deli@@ cious fish that i had on the evening . </s>
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted it . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , how does your fish taste so well ? &quot; </s>
he showed up on the al@@ ga@@ e . </s>
&quot; i know boy , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible . </s>
but what are your fish eating ? </s>
what is the for@@ age of food ? &quot; </s>
now , he &apos;s going to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat , what they would eat in the wild . </s>
the plan@@ ting bio@@ mass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , is the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , which is what the fish are feeding . </s>
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-@@ clean@@ ing . </s>
there &apos;s no food . </s>
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ? </s>
and later on , i went around this site with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been on , &quot; how do you measure ? &quot; </s>
the moment it was , it was as if a film director had to have a change in a ti@@ mel@@ ine . </s>
and we &apos;re bow around the corner , and we &apos;re off@@ ering the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pink fl@@ amin@@ gos , a literally br@@ and-@@ pet car@@ pet . </s>
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said . </s>
&quot; look at your tu@@ bes , pink . </s>
she dra@@ ws them . &quot; </s>
bad@@ way ? i was completely conf@@ used . </s>
i said , &quot; mi@@ look , don &apos;t you dra@@ g your fish ? &quot; </s>
&quot; yes , &quot; he said . </s>
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and fish to the birds . </s>
now last year , on this site , there were 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds , more than 250 different species . </s>
it &apos;s the largest and one of the most important private avi@@ an reser@@ ves in all of europe . </s>
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , is a very good bird was not the last thing you want to have on a fish ? &quot; </s>
he sho@@ ok his head , no . </s>
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building calcu@@ lations , not intensive . &quot; </s>
so , this is an environmental network , this is an environmental network . </s>
the fl@@ amin@@ gos is eating the shrimp . </s>
the shrimp eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton . </s>
so the pe@@ di@@ atri@@ cian of the bel@@ ly the better the system . &quot; </s>
okay , let &apos;s think about that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that meas@@ ures their success on the health of their predat@@ ors . </s>
a fish elev@@ ator , but also a bird reser@@ vation . </s>
oh , and by the way , these fl@@ amin@@ gos of fore@@ fall should not even be there . </s>
they bre@@ ed in a city 2@@ 40 miles , where the floor of the soil is better for nest ma@@ inten@@ ance . </s>
every morning , they fly 2@@ 40 miles to the farm . </s>
and every night , they fly 2@@ 40 miles back . </s>
they &apos;re doing that because they can follow the color@@ ed white line on the highway of a@@ 9@@ 2 . </s>
seriously . </s>
i had introduced a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el . </s>
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , fly 2@@ 40 miles out of the farm , and fly it up 2@@ 40 miles back in the evening ? </s>
do you do that for the children ? &quot; </s>
he looked at me as if i had just quot@@ ed a song by whit@@ ney hou@@ ston . </s>
he said , &quot; no . they do that because the food is better . &quot; </s>
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my belo@@ ved fish , which was deli@@ cious , and i don &apos;t like fish . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . </s>
it &apos;s this aw@@ k@@ ward , cont@@ amin@@ ated fla@@ vor . </s>
i almost never coo@@ ks around . </s>
and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in southern spa@@ in , she didn &apos;t take it to fish at all . </s>
she ta@@ sted cute and in the same way that you would take a bi@@ te off the ocean . </s>
i mentioned this to mi@@ gu@@ el and he ni@@ cked . </s>
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a spon@@ ge . </s>
she &apos;s the last a@@ er@@ ial before something inside the body . </s>
it has evolved in evolution in the course of the evolution of un@@ bu@@ mp@@ s . &quot; </s>
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no accident . &quot; </s>
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a farm that meas@@ ures their success at the success of their predat@@ ors . </s>
and then i realized , if he said , a farm that doesn &apos;t have an accident , it under@@ lies tremendous , because the water that flows through this farm comes from the river of gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r . </s>
it &apos;s a river that leads all of the things that ri@@ vers of ri@@ vers today tend to lead to you , chemical pollu@@ ting , chemical pollu@@ tan@@ ts , flow of cr@@ ab@@ s . </s>
and when it &apos;s f@@ ought through the system , and that leaves the water of the water , it &apos;s clean as it came in . </s>
the system is so healthy ; it cle@@ ans the water . </s>
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm measuring their success on the health of their predat@@ ors , but a farm that literally is a water res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion device , and not just for those fish , but for you and me . </s>
because when the water flows out , it sin@@ ks in the atlantic . </s>
a drop in the sea , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and i should do that , because this love story , as romantic as usual , is also coming up . </s>
you might say that you &apos;re a reci@@ pe for the future good food , whether we talk about bar@@ k or meat or meat . </s>
so what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture from one where food actually ta@@ stes well . </s>
but for a lot of people it &apos;s a bit too radical . </s>
we &apos;re not reali@@ sts ; we &apos;re enjo@@ ying . we are lo@@ vers . </s>
we love wee@@ k@@ ly markets . we love small family oper@@ ators . we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat bi@@ o . </s>
and when they claim that these are the things that the future of good food is going to as@@ sure up and say , &quot; hey guys , i love pink fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how are they going to feed the world ? </s>
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot; </s>
can i be honest ? </s>
i don &apos;t like that question . </s>
no , not because we &apos;ve already producing enough cal@@ ories to feed the world more than just feeding the world . </s>
one billion people are going to be star@@ ving today . </s>
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- due to cr@@ as@@ ser ine@@ quality in distribution , not the total production . </s>
well , i don &apos;t like this question because it has defined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years . </s>
dri@@ ll@@ er grain of plant cro@@ ps , cr@@ us@@ hing supp@@ lies of mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals to the earth , chicken to fish , and all the time the far@@ ming industry simply said , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can that be ? &quot; </s>
that was the motivation . it was the justi@@ fication . it was the business of american agriculture . </s>
we should call them what she is , a com@@ mu@@ te in a mu@@ ti@@ lation , a gest@@ ure that is rapidly ecolo@@ gical capital that en@@ ables the production of this production . </s>
this is not a commercial , and it &apos;s not agriculture . </s>
our cor@@ n@@ cham@@ mer is threat@@ ened today , not because of taking off , but based on the dis@@ pos@@ al of resources . </s>
not through the latest cho@@ p and tra@@ ctor inven@@ tions , but through ferti@@ le land , not by pump , but through fresh water , not through cha@@ ins , but by forest , not by fishing bo@@ ats and nets , but through fish in the ocean . </s>
they want to feed the world ? </s>
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ? </s>
or better , how can we create conditions that em@@ power any community to feed themselves ? </s>
in order to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future . </s>
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done . </s>
capital , chemistry and machines are in o@@ ben@@ an , and it never made anything really good for food . </s>
now , let &apos;s look at the ecolo@@ gical model of the ecolo@@ gical model . </s>
this is what takes back to two billion years of work . </s>
look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el . </s>
businesses that are not worlds , businesses that are re@@ stor@@ ed instead of nee@@ ding re@@ stor@@ ative , businesses , rather than just intense , farmers who are not only gener@@ ators , but experts for relationships . </s>
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste . </s>
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be . </s>
you know , i &apos;m right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be deli@@ cious . </s>
thank you . </s>
and if i want to close to you one thing today is that the total amount of data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts , and rather than thinking about information about information , i want you to think about how we can use information to be able to use that pattern , and we can see trends that otherwise would not be visible . </s>
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical ster@@ eu@@ graph of age . </s>
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment . </s>
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t , and what i can do with pi@@ vo@@ t is that i can filter after a certain cause of death , let &apos;s say accidents . </s>
and i immediately see another pattern that makes it possible . </s>
and that is because in the middle of the middle , people are most active and they &apos;re most u@@ pli@@ f@@ ting over the world . </s>
we can go one step further , and re@@ ar@@ range the data , and see that , you know , that car@@ dio@@ vas@@ cular disease and cancer are the usual suspe@@ cts , but not for everyone . </s>
now , as we go on and form age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the major thing that people should worry about . </s>
and who &apos;s further research is that this is particularly true with men . </s>
so what you see is that looking at information and data in this way is remin@@ is@@ cent of swimming in a living information graph . </s>
and if we can do that for raw data , why not for content itself ? </s>
what we have here is the cover pictures of every single &quot; sport illu@@ sions , &quot; which have ever been prin@@ ted . </s>
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online . </s>
you &apos;d like to test it after my talk in your rooms . </s>
with pi@@ vo@@ t , they can dive into a decade . </s>
you can dive into a particular year . </s>
you can jump directly to a certain copy . </s>
now , when i look here , i see the athle@@ tes that appear in that copy and the spor@@ ting species . </s>
i am a lan@@ ce arm@@ strong fan , so i &apos;m going to click on this for all expen@@ ses that lan@@ ce is mentioned in the lan@@ ce of lan@@ ce . </s>
now , if i just want to get a bigger over@@ view , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i see everything with this topic of bi@@ king ? &quot; </s>
so i go step back , and i &apos;ll move it back to the beginning . </s>
now i see gre@@ g le@@ moon . </s>
and so , you get an idea that if you look through this kind of information , more tar@@ ge@@ ted , bro@@ a@@ der , rein@@ zoom out , you &apos;re not looking , or you &apos;re not looking , you know , you &apos;re not just looking for sur@@ fing . </s>
you do something that &apos;s actually a bit different . </s>
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used . </s>
i want to take this idea a little bit more , with something a little bit more crazy . </s>
so what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad pe@@ di@@ atri@@ cian and reduce them on a small basis . </s>
the sum@@ mary is a short over@@ view and a symbol of the field that she comes out of . </s>
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the most popular wi@@ pe@@ di@@ ans . </s>
but even in that constra@@ int , we can do a lot of things . </s>
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are most popular on wikipedia . </s>
i &apos;m going to vote for government . </s>
now , after i chose government , i know that the wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ ak@@ at@@ at@@ ories that make the most time time magazine &quot; people of the year . &quot; </s>
this is really important because this is a reali@@ zation that doesn &apos;t have a single wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ atri@@ cian . </s>
it &apos;s only to see if you take a step back and look at the whole thing . </s>
looking at a certain amount of sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can then go into time magazine &quot; people of the year &quot; people in the year , and they all see together . </s>
now , when i look at all these people , i know that the majority of them are government offi@@ ci@@ als . some of them come from science . some , even less , come out of the economy . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes out of the music . </s>
and interestingly , bon@@ o is also a ted prize w@@ inner . </s>
so we can jump now and look at all the ted prize w@@ inn@@ ers . </s>
you see , we sur@@ fing on the web the first time it &apos;s really a net , not just from page to page , but much more abstract . </s>
and so i want to show you what a little bit of a surprise could be . </s>
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website . </s>
pi@@ vo@@ t , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can look at websites with this -- and we bring that zo@@ om@@ -@@ technology to every single website like this . </s>
so i can take a step back , and go right into a specific se@@ ction . </s>
this is important because , by looking at web pages in this way , you can see the whole internet trend in the same way . </s>
so i can zoom in in my course in a certain way . </s>
here &apos;s the state of the whole dem@@ o i kept going through here . </s>
and i can sort of take anything that i &apos;ve been looking back at today . </s>
and , if i go back and look at everything , i can re@@ ar@@ range my trajec@@ tory from my search past my search past my search past , and here i was looking for ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic , right here , or here to live labs pi@@ vo@@ t . </s>
and from here , i can go into the side and call it back up . </s>
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it makes the big picture bigger than the sum of the date . </s>
right now , in this world , we think that data is a cur@@ se . </s>
we talk about the cur@@ se of information flow . </s>
we &apos;re talking about dro@@ w@@ ning information . </s>
what if we could turn this situation around and put the internet on its head so that instead of going from one to another , we start to go from many things to many things , and to see patterns that would have otherwise hidden hidden ? </s>
if we can do that , that bis@@ cu@@ red piece of data is going to be a new source of information . </s>
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge of it . </s>
and if we know how to know , maybe we can even draw wisdom from that . </s>
i stop that , thank you very much . </s>
i grew up with a hearing of science fiction . </s>
i went to school in my school day , and i went one hour every day for one hour every day . </s>
and my nose was always stuck in a book , a science fiction book that de@@ als my mind in other worlds , and in the history of a story , my deep curiosity began to satis@@ fy my mind . </s>
this curiosity also showed that i always , when i was not in school , stre@@ t@@ ched out through the forest , and he wander@@ ed , and the spec@@ im@@ ens , the fro@@ gs and the sna@@ kes and d@@ ough and d@@ ough and d@@ ough and looked at it all home and looked at the microscope under the microscope . </s>
i was totally excited , you know . </s>
it was always about trying to understand the world and to explore the limits of the possible . </s>
and my love of science fiction seemed to be refle@@ cted in my neighborhood , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and we explor@@ ed the deep sea . </s>
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au came into our living room with his fascinating tv shows that showed us animals and places and a world of mira@@ cles that we could never have imagined before . </s>
so that would be very good at this kind of science fiction role . </s>
and i was an artist . </s>
i could draw . i could paint . </s>
and because there &apos;s neither video games nor the inter@@ se@@ ctions of computer-@@ generated movies , all the ima@@ gery in the media landscape , i had to make the images in my head . </s>
we had to do that at the time . when we read a book to read a book , we took the descri@@ ption of the author descri@@ bed the descri@@ ption of the author and proje@@ cted it into our heads . </s>
my response to that was drawing and painting of aliens , alien worlds , robots , spac@@ es@@ hip and all that kind of thing . </s>
in math class , i was constantly caught by the teachers , like i was hidden in the back text@@ book . </s>
creativity had to somehow out . </s>
and something interesting happened . what was fascinated by jac@@ ques jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ ff was the thought of a completely unknown world for us here on our earth . </s>
certainly , i would never reach an alien world with a spac@@ es@@ hip , and that seemed pretty unlikely to me . </s>
but here was a world i was able to walk into , here on earth , and she was just as fascinating and ex@@ otic as all that i had ever imagined when i was reading these books . </s>
so i decided when i was 15 , i was going to go to dea@@ f . </s>
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , a thousand kilometers away from the next ocean . </s>
but i didn &apos;t get out of that . </s>
i ch@@ ased my father , until finally , a sub@@ set school in buff@@ al@@ o , new york , had made fin@@ dings , right on the other side of the border where we lived . </s>
i made my dive in a pool of operation in the middle of winter in buff@@ al@@ o , new york . </s>
but the ocean , a real ocean , i just got to face two years later when we moved to california . </s>
since then , in the 40 years by now , i spent about 3,000 hours underwater underwater , 500 hours of it in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles . </s>
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat ocean , is so rich in the way that we can really even imagine it . </s>
the notion of nature doesn &apos;t know any limits , as opposed to our own , fa@@ int human imagination . </s>
until today , i feel deep@@ est a@@ we for what i see on my dive . </s>
and my love for the ocean is holding up with the same inten@@ sity as e@@ h and ever . </s>
when i was making a job as an adult , it was the film@@ making . </s>
this seemed the best way to tell my inner insi@@ des , to tell stories , with my need to create images , to uni@@ te . </s>
as a child , i always drew com@@ ic books and so on . </s>
so movies were the way to bring images and stories together . this was what fit together . </s>
of course , the stories i was looking for out of science fiction , &quot; termin@@ ator , &quot; &quot; termin@@ ator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot; </s>
in &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i was able to connect my taste of the underwater world and diving with the film@@ making . </s>
so basically , my two passi@@ ons shif@@ ted . </s>
something interesting happened on &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; : to solve a narrative problem in this film -- and we had to create some sort of liquid water , and we moved on computer-@@ generated animation , c@@ g , back . </s>
and what came out of this was the first computer-@@ generated software sur@@ m that &apos;s ever seen in a film . </s>
the film didn &apos;t take any money , in fact , he was playing his production cost , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like h@@ yp@@ noti@@ zed by the magic that went out of it . </s>
well , according to arthur clar@@ ke &apos;s law , we &apos;re known as advanced advanced technology and magic to not inter@@ f@@ ere with each other . </s>
so they saw something ma@@ gical . </s>
and i found that terri@@ bly exciting . </s>
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s got to be involved in film art . &quot; </s>
so we went in &quot; termin@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next film , much more . </s>
so with il@@ m , we created this guy from liquid metal , and the success was very much about how this effect would arri@@ ve . </s>
and it worked . again , we had created something ma@@ gical , and the impact in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve played a little bit of money with the film . </s>
from those two experience , a whole new world was reached , a whole new world of creativity for film making . </s>
so i started a company , along with my good friend , stan win@@ ston , who was at the time of the best ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up and cre@@ atu@@ red designer designer . it was called &quot; digital do@@ main . &quot; </s>
the basic idea of this company was to ski@@ p the stage analo@@ g processes with op@@ tical prin@@ ters , etc . , and start with digital produ@@ ctions right now . </s>
so that &apos;s what we did , and we managed to have a competi@@ tive advantage such a long time ago . </s>
but in the mid@@ - &apos; 90s , we realized that in the cre@@ atu@@ re@@ us and the final design design -- what we really did was we started the company -- we started to move forward . </s>
i had written this piece of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; which was going to push the measu@@ rements of visual effects and computer-@@ generated effects in new hei@@ ghts , with reali@@ stic human , expres@@ sive characters that have been produced by c@@ g , and the main characters should all be c@@ ough . and the world should be c@@ ough . </s>
but the measuring squ@@ ee@@ zed is quite beautiful , and the people in my company told me that we were not going to be able to do that yet . </s>
so i shif@@ ted that and made this other film about the big ship that goes on . </s>
the movie studio , i sold this as &quot; ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ ting ju@@ lie@@ t , &quot; it became a kind of ep@@ iso@@ de of epi@@ c , a passionate film . </s>
but secre@@ tly , i really wanted to go to the real w@@ re@@ ck of the titan@@ ic . </s>
that &apos;s why i made the film . </s>
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that . </s>
but i convinced them , but i said , &quot; we &apos;re diving to the w@@ re@@ ck . we &apos;re movies the real w@@ re@@ ck . </s>
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film . </s>
that &apos;s enor@@ m@@ ously important . it &apos;s a good news for marketing . &quot; </s>
and i convinced them to fund an expedition . </s>
sounds crazy . but again , it goes back to that , that your imagination can create a reality . </s>
and then , in fact , six months later , we created a reality where i &apos;d re@@ found myself in a russi@@ an sub@@ mer@@ sible , four miles underneath the surface of the north atlantic , looking at the real titan@@ ic through a bu@@ ll@@ eye . </s>
this was not a movie , no h@@ d , that was real . </s>
well , that really ble@@ w my mind . </s>
and the prepar@@ ation for that was enormous . we had to build cameras and head@@ lights and all kinds of things . </s>
and i realized how much these profound things like this profound space mission look like . </s>
well , they were also highly reli@@ able and dur@@ able planning . </s>
you go up into these cap@@ su@@ les , you go down into this dark , ho@@ sti@@ le environment where there &apos;s no hope for rescu@@ e if you don &apos;t get it back . </s>
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s as though i &apos;m in a science fiction movie . </s>
that &apos;s pretty cool . &quot; </s>
i was quite obsessed with the study of the deep sea . </s>
anyway , the part that has to do with curiosity and science . it was all . it was ad@@ vent@@ ures , it was curiosity . it was imagination . </s>
and it was a experience that was not able to give me hollywood . </s>
because , you know , i was able to imagine a creature that we could then make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the window . </s>
in some of the following expedi@@ tions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in ther@@ mal sources , and sometimes things i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , and the science that the science had seen , when we saw them , had found no words at all . </s>
so this really fol@@ ded me , and i wanted more . </s>
and so i then met an unusual decision . </s>
after the success of titan@@ ic , i told myself , &quot; okay , i want to put my major job as a film@@ maker in hollywood to ice , and i &apos;ll be full-@@ time researchers for a while . &quot; </s>
and then we started , we showed up to the bis@@ mar@@ ck , and we explor@@ ed it with robots . </s>
we went back to the w@@ re@@ ck of the titan@@ ic . </s>
we took little robots that we built , which wra@@ pped up a fiber op@@ tic cable . </s>
our in@@ tent was to dive in and look at the inside of the ships which had never been done before . </s>
no one had explor@@ ed the inside of the w@@ re@@ ck , and they didn &apos;t have any means for that . so , we developed the technology . </s>
so that &apos;s where i &apos;m sitting on the de@@ ck of the titan@@ ic de@@ ck , in a sub@@ mer@@ sible , and you see plan@@ ks that these bre@@ eds are very similar here , and i know that the tape was playing there . </s>
and i &apos;m going to fly a little robotic stuff through the ed@@ ges of the ships . </s>
i &apos;m actually doing it only , but my consciousness is within the vehicle . </s>
it felt like i &apos;m physically atten@@ ding within the shi@@ pping w@@ re@@ ck of the titan@@ ic . </s>
this was the sur@@ real form of a d@@ é@@ j@@ los v@@ u v@@ u that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i got around a corner of a corner , i always knew what was going on in the light bul@@ b of the vehicle , because i walked over the movie for months , because i was making the film over the movie set , when we turned the film . </s>
and the set was a very accurate copy of the ships of the ship . </s>
so this was a very strange experience . </s>
she was aware of this tele@@ presence experience , that you can use such robotic a@@ vat@@ ars , and that &apos;s how your consciousness can move into the vehicle into this other form of existence . </s>
it was really , really profound profound . </s>
and perhaps a little view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have cy@@ bor@@ g body to explore something or to do other things , in all sorts of post-@@ human@@ i@@ ties fu@@ tures , which i can imagine as the science fiction fan . </s>
so , after these expedi@@ tions , we started to appreciate what we &apos;ve seen down there , for example , for example , for example , for example , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are kind of alien , but here on earth . </s>
they use chemo@@ syn@@ thesis with chemo@@ syn@@ thesis . </s>
they don &apos;t exist in one on sunlight based on how we do it . </s>
and so you can see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centi@@ grade , that they can survive there . </s>
at the same time , i was also really interested in space science , which was again the science fiction influence from my childhood . </s>
and so i ended up in the people who are interested in space and have to do with nasa and are sitting in the nasa expres@@ sions of space and right space , and they drive to russia , and they go through russia , and they go through the mission of the bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal proto@@ co@@ l , all the way to the international space station , and we &apos;re going to fly our 3d camera ste@@ am . </s>
that was fascinating . </s>
but at the end of the day , i ran out of space scientists with us in the deep sea . </s>
i took them and for@@ gotten them access to the world down there : astro@@ biologists , planet@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the sources of the world so they could look around , take samples and test instruments and so on . </s>
we were making docum@@ entary films , but actually did science , more specifically , to say , space science . </s>
so , the circle between my existence was as science fiction , at the time , as a child , and the trans@@ lation into reality . </s>
in the course of this discovery of discovery , i learned a lot . </s>
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i certainly think that a director must also have to lead , a leader like a ship cap@@ tains or something like that . </s>
but i didn &apos;t understand much of leadership before i joined these expedi@@ tions . </s>
because at a certain point i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ? </s>
why do i do that ? what &apos;s coming out of this ? &quot; </s>
these stupid movies don &apos;t bring us any money . </s>
we &apos;re just playing the production cost here , from f@@ ame no lan@@ e . </s>
everybody thinking i &apos;d gone from titan@@ ic and a@@ vat@@ ar &apos;s a@@ vat@@ ar , and i would have celebr@@ ated the na@@ ils somewhere on a beach on a beach . </s>
i &apos;ve got all these films , these docum@@ entary films , for a very small audience . </s>
no f@@ ame , no honor , no money . what do you do ? </s>
you &apos;re going to do it for the problem of the challenge , the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment , and you make it , and because of the weird connection that emer@@ ges when a small group of people make a team . </s>
because we &apos;ve done all this with just 10 to 12 people who worked un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted for years and years , and sometimes we were two to three months back in the sea . </s>
and in that community , you realize that the most important thing that you have is the attention that you have in front of each other , because you &apos;ve done a job that you can &apos;t explain anything else . </s>
if you go back to land , and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the fi@@ ber@@ glass , the we@@ dding we@@ ak@@ ness , and the whole prin@@ ce , all the technology , and the difficul@@ ty , the difficul@@ ty of human performance , when you &apos;re working on lake , &quot; you can &apos;t explain the other . that &apos;s like poli@@ ce@@ men or soldiers , or soldiers , you can never explain that you can never explain it to anyone . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
there &apos;s a connection , a mu@@ tual respect . </s>
so when i came back to turn my next film , &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you respe@@ cted your team and you ear@@ n your respect in the return of your respect . </s>
by doing that , the dynamic was really changed . </s>
so that &apos;s where i stood with a little bit of a unknown team , and we turned &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; with a new technique that didn &apos;t exist before . </s>
hu@@ gely exciting . </s>
a tremendous challenge . </s>
and we have been to a right family for a four-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years period . </s>
in this way , my way of making films was completely completely different . </s>
there were people who thought we would have done these oceans really well , and we would have transpor@@ ted on the planet p@@ and@@ ora . </s>
for me , it was more of a principle of how to do my job , the actual process that changed the outcome . </s>
so what can we close from all of this ? </s>
what lessons have we learned ? </s>
and i think , first of all , curiosity is curiosity . </s>
it &apos;s the most powerful human quality . </s>
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality . </s>
and the awareness of a team is more important than all the lau@@ ghter of this world . </s>
to me , young film@@ makers who say , &quot; give me some advice of how i can do this . &quot; </s>
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t limit yourself . </s>
it &apos;s got some other for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t do it against yourself . take risks on you . &quot; </s>
nasa has such a favorite sentence : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot; </s>
but in art , and when you explore , fail has to be an alternative , because it guaran@@ te@@ es a tru@@ st@@ ence . </s>
not an important enter@@ prise that dem@@ anded innovation was ever add@@ ressed with a risk of risk . </s>
you have to be prepared to take these risks . </s>
so that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to leave you with , and failure is an alternative , but fear is not . thank you . </s>
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate . </s>
and this may be surprising because my full-@@ time engagement in the foundation is mostly ro@@ tat@@ ing by vaccin@@ es and sa@@ ves for the things that we need to invent and deliver to the poorest two billion a better life . </s>
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually more important than any other on the planet . </s>
climate change means that their sa@@ ves are not going to grow up for many years ; we &apos;re too much rain , and things are going to change the way that their fragi@@ le environment can &apos;t change . </s>
that leads to star@@ vation . it leads to un@@ certainty . it leads to ru@@ dder . </s>
so , climate change will be terrible for you . </s>
and also , the energy cycle for them is very important . </s>
and the fact is , if you could only reduce the price of the price of poverty , energy would be the most effective energy of the most effective . </s>
well , the energy cycle has fallen over time . </s>
in fact , the progress society is based on energy progress . </s>
co@@ hl@@ er@@ evolution drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a ra@@ pid case of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air condi@@ tioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things . </s>
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world . </s>
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price hal@@ f@@ way -- let &apos;s go to a new bar@@ rier , and that bar@@ rier is linked to co2 . </s>
co2 war@@ ms the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear . </s>
you add the ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ating co2 of co2 that leads to temperature increase , and that temperature increase has some very negative effects . effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the indi@@ c@@ ates that the natural ecosystems cannot adapt to these ra@@ pid changes , and so they collapse all the way . </s> systems together . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
now , the exact cor@@ relation between a co2 rise , and that &apos;s going to result in temperature , and where the other consequences are , there &apos;s some un@@ clar@@ ity , but not very many of them . </s>
and there &apos;s certainly un@@ clar@@ ity about how bad these things are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad . </s>
i &apos;ve asked the top of the top scientists a few times : &quot; do we really need to go down to zero ? </s>
does not enough half or a quarter of a quarter ? &quot; </s>
and the answer is : until we get close to zero , the temperature will go further . </s>
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge . </s>
it &apos;s very different than saying that we have a 3.@@ 5 foot truck , which has to be under a three foot bridge , and then you can sort of squ@@ ee@@ ze it underneath . </s>
this one needs to go down , zero . </s>
well , we &apos;re hit@@ ting a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons of carbon dioxide . </s>
each american americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one . </s>
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for anybody on the planet . </s>
and somehow we have to make changes that go down to zero . </s>
it &apos;s been constant all the time . </s>
only different economic changes have actually influ@@ enced it , and we need to go from ra@@ pid increase to reduce the rise and to reduce a reduction to zero . </s>
this equation has four factors . a bit multipli@@ cation . you &apos;ve got this thing on the left -- co2 -- which you want to get towards zero , and that will depend on the number of people , from the ser@@ v@@ ant , the average of every human being , the average energy for every service and co2 that &apos;s being em@@ it@@ ted by the energy unit of energy . </s>
so let &apos;s look at each factor in one case and think about how we get to zero . </s>
probably one of those numbers must get very close to zero . </s>
now this is basic al@@ ge@@ bra , but let &apos;s go through it . </s>
first , we have the population . </s>
today , 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people live . </s>
and it goes to nine billion , which is to move to nine billion dollars . </s>
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccin@@ es , health care and re@@ production medicine , we could reduce that by 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slo@@ pe for 1.@@ 3 . </s>
the second factor is the services we use . </s>
it &apos;s all about the food that we eat , clo@@ thing , television , he@@ ating . </s>
these are very good things and poverty reduction , to make these services accessible to almost everyone on the planet . </s>
it &apos;s great that this number is rising . </s>
in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to go down and use less , but on average , that number is going to go out every year and have more than double , the number of services that per person &apos;s person will be willing to do . </s>
there &apos;s a very basic service here . is it light home home so that you can read the home@@ work home@@ work ? </s>
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and they read their school problems under the street . </s>
well , for efficiency , the e , energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news . </s>
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up . </s>
because of different success@@ es in the light sector , through other au@@ pp@@ yp@@ es , through new methods in building , there &apos;s a lot of services , and there &apos;s a lot of services whose energy costs are going to reduce some individual services by 90 percent . </s>
in other countries , like making fertili@@ zers of fertili@@ zers , 10@@ 5 00 : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 6@@ ,000 -- &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; 5@@ 5 : 5@@ 8@@ ,000 , 5@@ 8@@ ,000 or air traffic , or air traffic , is a lot smaller for impro@@ ving impro@@ v@@ ements . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we get re@@ ducing a factor of three or maybe a factor of 6@@ th . </s>
but in the first three factors , we &apos;ve now gone from 26 billion to the most best 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough ! </s>
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that per energy unit of energy is em@@ it@@ ting . </s>
it &apos;s the question of if you can get that to zero . </s>
when you burn coal , no . </s>
when they burn natural gas , no . </s>
almost every manufacturing method for electricity today em@@ its co2 , except renew@@ ables and nuclear energy . </s>
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system . </s>
we need energy mira@@ cles . </s>
now , if i use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible . </s>
the micro@@ process@@ or is a miracle . the computer is a miracle . </s>
the internet and its service is a miracle . </s>
people here have contribu@@ ted to a lot of this wonder . </s>
and usually there &apos;s no dead@@ line that you need a miracle to a certain date . </s>
it &apos;s usually only wrong , and some people don &apos;t get it . </s>
but in this case , we have to give full gas and get a miracle in a very short time . </s>
now , i was thinking , how can i really get this out ? </s>
is there a natural illu@@ stration , a dem@@ o that represents the idea of people &apos;s imagination here ? </s>
i remember@@ ed the following year when i got mosqu@@ itos and kind of liked the people . </s>
the idea became really tan@@ gible to them , you know , that there are people who live with mosqu@@ itos . </s>
and for energy , this is what i came up with . </s>
i decided that the release of fire@@ flies would be my year contribu@@ ting to the environment here . </s>
so here &apos;s some natural fire@@ flies . </s>
i &apos;m sure you didn &apos;t bi@@ te , you know , you &apos;re not even going to get rid of the glass . </s>
well , there are all sorts of play solutions like this , but they don &apos;t bring all that much . </s>
we need solutions , either one or many that have an uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able sc@@ aling and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able reli@@ able , and even though there are lots of directions where people are looking for it , i really only see five who can afford these big dem@@ ands . </s>
i &apos;ve left times , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion and bio@@ fuels . </s>
these may be a moder@@ ate contribu@@ tion , and if you do better than i expect , that would be great , but my point here is that we have to work on all these five , and we can &apos;t give them any of them because they &apos;re inti@@ ma@@ tely , because they all have significant problems . </s>
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas . </s>
what you have to do there seems to be simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to catch all the co2 that comes out of the chim@@ ne@@ ck out of the chim@@ ne@@ ys , under pressure , and then down@@ load somewhere and hope that it sta@@ ys there . </s>
there are some mush@@ room projects that can do that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but get it to 100 percent , and it will be very difficult to get into the la@@ p of co2 , is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the war@@ e@@ time question . </s>
who is going to make it safe ? </s>
who can guaran@@ tee something that literally makes a lot of billions of times bigger than any kind of garbage that you can imagine from nuclear and other things ? </s>
that &apos;s a lot of volume . </s>
so that &apos;s a hard thing to do . </s>
next : nuclear energy . </s>
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in highly regul@@ ated countries , is high . the question for sure that you really feel that nothing can go wrong despite the human contribu@@ tion that the fuel is not used for weapons . </s>
and then what do you do with the waste ? </s>
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern@@ s . </s>
so three very difficult problems that might be solu@@ ble , and that &apos;s where you should work . </s>
i &apos;ve sum@@ mar@@ ized the last three of the five . </s>
it &apos;s renew@@ ables , it &apos;s been called a lot of renew@@ ables . </s>
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some dra@@ w@@ backs . </s>
one is the energy edi@@ ting that these technologies generate dramatically lower than the power plants are . </s>
these are energy energy , you &apos;re talking about a lot of square kilometers , a thousand times more area than a normal power station . </s>
the other thing is that these sources are inter@@ rup@@ ting . </s>
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , but it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and it doesn &apos;t look the wind as well as the wind . </s>
that &apos;s why , if you have to depend on these sources , you have to have a way of getting energy in times when it &apos;s not available in time . </s>
so there are great challenges . there are challenges in trans@@ mission . if we say , for example , the energy source outside the country is , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they need to deal with the risk that the energy from where is coming from . </s>
and there &apos;s the stor@@ age problem . </s>
and in order to show the dimension , i &apos;ve been looking at all kinds of batter@@ ies that are made for cars , computers , mobile phones , flash@@ lights , for everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with the amount of electronic energy that the world is using , and i found out that all batter@@ ies that we now produce , less than 10 minutes of the entire energy energy . </s>
so we need a big break@@ through here , something that will be a factor 100 better than the approach@@ es to time . </s>
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy . </s>
this is what happens when you try to get these inter@@ rup@@ ted sources about saying 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumption . </s>
if you want to rely on 100 percent on it , you need an incredible wonder . </s>
well , where should we go , what is the right approach ? </s>
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ? </s>
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of them . </s>
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people . </s>
in many people , they &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good . </s>
so i think there &apos;s a lot here in the ted group that are already engaged in this ted group . </s>
bill gross has multiple companies among other people named es@@ ol@@ ar who has the great solar ther@@ mal@@ s . </s>
vin@@ deaths k@@ ho@@ s@@ la invest@@ ments in do@@ zens of companies doing great things and have interesting opportunities and i try to support that . </s>
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i fund a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is pur@@ su@@ ing the nuclear approach . </s>
there &apos;s some innovation in the nuclear . mod@@ ul@@ es , liquid . </s>
the development has heard in this industry a long time ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts are around . </s>
the ter@@ ra@@ power@@ -@@ concept means that instead of a part of ur@@ ans , one percent that u@@ 2@@ 35 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . </s>
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea . </s>
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time , but you never could simu@@ late any reas@@ onable whether it would work , but since there &apos;s modern super@@ computers , you can simu@@ late it and see that , yes ! with the right materi@@ ali@@ stic approach , it looks like it &apos;s working . </s>
and because you burn this 99 percent , the co@@ profile is much better . </s>
in fact , you burn the garbage , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s re@@ actors as a fuel . </s>
instead of breaking your head on it , you just burn it . one great thing . </s>
the ur@@ ani@@ um is being used gradu@@ ally , a little bit like a cand@@ le . </s>
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of pill@@ ar , often known as the traveling wave wave re@@ actor . </s>
that really sol@@ ves the fuel problem . </s>
this is a picture of a place in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky . </s>
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that &apos;s now bur@@ ned out now , so it &apos;s called a sky@@ rock@@ eting ur@@ ani@@ um . </s>
the drive the u.s. for hundreds of years . </s>
and when you make ocean water cheap and just fil@@ med , you get enough fuel for the rest of the life of the planet . </s>
you know , there &apos;s still a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward . </s>
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success . </s>
what should our te@@ stim@@ ony look like ? </s>
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to reach , and then we talk about the inter@@ section . </s>
a lot of talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . </s>
it &apos;s really , really important that we get there . </s>
the rest 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still some far@@ ming . hopefully whale dro@@ pping and cement , and cement , will be clean . </s>
so , to reach that 80 percent , the industrial states , including countries like china , have to completely re@@ constit@@ ute their electricity generation . </s>
the other note tells us whether we &apos;re using zero emissions in technology , whether it &apos;s in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest of it . </s>
that &apos;s great important . </s>
and that becomes a key element of this stuff . </s>
if we go back from there , what should the 20@@ 20 note look like ? </s>
it should con@@ tain the two elements again . </s>
we should use the efficiency of efficiency to bring re@@ duc@@ tions in the path , the less we em@@ it@@ ted , the less the co2 will be , and also the temperature of the temperature . </s>
but in fact , this note for the things that we do , which don &apos;t completely lead to the major re@@ duc@@ tions , just the same , or even slightly more important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for these break@@ through@@ s . </s>
we need to track those break@@ through@@ s with full gas , and we can measure that : in corporate numbers , into mush@@ room projects and regu@@ lation changes . </s>
there are a lot of great books about this . </s>
the al gore book , &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david m@@ ck@@ a@@ ys &quot; sustainable energy from hot air . &quot; </s>
they really go through and create a frame where this can be discus@@ sed in a lot of the time , because we need support from all sides . </s>
there &apos;s a lot that needs to come together . </s>
that &apos;s a wish . </s>
a very concrete wish is that we invent this technology . </s>
if you just raise a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love this wish , or i could choose that wish , which is that half of the energy &apos;s energy cycle without co2 is going to come up with that wish . </s>
this has the biggest impact . </s>
if we don &apos;t get that wish , the dig@@ ging between long-term and shor@@ t-@@ term people will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of the life of these two billion are going to be much worse . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
so what do we need to do ? </s>
what do i appe@@ al to ? </s>
we need to use it for more research . </s>
when countries meet in places like cop@@ ying , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 . </s>
they should discuss these innovation strategy , and they would be sho@@ cked by the ridiculous lo@@ ads that are going to be spent for those innovative approach@@ es . </s>
we need market travel , co2 ta@@ xes , r &amp; amp ; d , something that creates a price signal . </s> &amp; amp ; d is something that makes a prize . </s> &amp; amp ; d &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
we need to spread the message . </s>
we need to make dialo@@ gue more rational and complete and also the things that are under@@ taken by the government . </s>
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can ful@@ fill it . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you . thank you ! </s>
thank you very much . just to understand ter@@ ra@@ power -- first of all , can you give us an idea of the mag@@ ni@@ tude of this investment ? </s>
bill gates : to do the simulation on a super@@ computer , get all the major scientists that we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make sure that it works sensi@@ bly , you &apos;re just in the 10@@ 0@@ 0s . </s>
the hard step is that building the first re@@ actor , the building of another billion , the regul@@ ari@@ ans and the place that really buil@@ ds the first one . </s>
once the first is done , when it goes as well as promis@@ es , it &apos;s all clear , because the economic , the energy density is so different than nuclear energy , as we know it . </s>
to understand that , that means to build deep in the ground almost like a vertical colum@@ n nuclear fuel , the ur@@ ans , and then the process starts up , and it &apos;s working down , and it &apos;s working down on the bottom ? </s>
b@@ g : right . now , you &apos;ve got to re@@ cover the re@@ actor , so there &apos;s a lot of people and lots of contro@@ ver@@ sy that can go wrong . this thing where you open it up and get stuff inside -- that &apos;s not good . </s>
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a colum@@ n -- which you bu@@ ried , without all the comple@@ xi@@ ties . </s>
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it bur@@ ns for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done . </s>
a nuclear re@@ actor , which has to provide itself a solution to the garbage . </s>
b@@ g : yeah . now , what happens with the garbage : you can let it sit -- there &apos;s much less waste with this technology -- then you take it and put it in the next re@@ actor , and then you burn it . </s>
and we start by taking the garbage that already exists , which is in these re@@ actors , or dry contain@@ ers to the re@@ actors . that &apos;s our fuel fuel . </s>
so what these re@@ actors have been a problem for , what we fill in in our lives , is that the waste of the waste is dramatically reduced by the waste of this process . </s>
but while you &apos;ve talked to different people in the world about these opportunities . </s>
where is the greatest interest in getting this to really start ? </s>
b@@ g : well , we haven &apos;t set up a place yet , and there &apos;s a lot of an interesting policy set for everything called &quot; nuclear &quot; -- there &apos;s a lot of interest and the people of the company in russia , india , china -- i was here , and i was here , and i talked to the energy agenda , and i talked about how this fits to the energy agenda . </s>
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese did something in the direction . </s>
this is a vari@@ ant of one thing that was made . </s>
that &apos;s an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster re@@ actor and some countries built this , so anyone who has a quick quick re@@ actor is a candi@@ date for our first . </s>
in their impres@@ sion , ti@@ ming and like@@ li@@ hood of calling something like this ? </s>
b@@ g : well , we need one of these sc@@ aling , stre@@ t@@ ching things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to invent and then for 20 years . </s>
that &apos;s kind of the dead@@ line that shows us the environmental models that we need to think about . </s>
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ power , when everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could keep it easy . </s>
and lu@@ ck@@ ily , there are do@@ zens of companies today , and we need hundreds of companies , and we need hundreds of them , so if their approach@@ es work , the funding for their pil@@ ots work for their pil@@ es for it . </s>
and it would be best if it could be multiple , because then you could use a mix@@ ture . </s>
anyway , we need a solution . </s>
ad@@ ju@@ sted of the great break@@ through@@ s , is this the biggest you know ? </s>
b@@ g : an energy break@@ through is the most important thing . </s>
it would have been something that would have been the environmental requi@@ rement , but it still makes it so much more important . </s>
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies . </s>
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s a mod@@ ular method , which is another approach . </s>
there &apos;s a liquid re@@ actor guy that seems a little bit difficult , but maybe they say that it &apos;s about us . </s>
and so there &apos;s different , but the beautiful thing is that a ur@@ ani@@ um molecule has a million times as much energy as a , let &apos;s say , a coal molecule , and that &apos;s why , if you can deal with the problems , and that &apos;s basically the radiation , the footprint and the cost , the potential , the impact on the land and other things , almost in a own lea@@ gue . </s>
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ? </s>
do we have to introduce emergency meas@@ ures to try to keep the world &apos;s temperature stable ? </s>
b@@ g : so when you get into this situation , it &apos;s like having too much e@@ aten in front of a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a heart surgery or something like that . </s>
there &apos;s a research that &apos;s called geo@@ engineering , which involves various techniques for various techniques to del@@ ay warming , so that we can get 20 or 30 years longer to come together . </s>
this is just a insurance method . </s>
you hope we don &apos;t need it . </s>
some people say , you don &apos;t really want to work on insurance because you &apos;re la@@ zy , so you keep eating because you know that you &apos;re going to save the heart surgery . </s>
and i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you think about the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a dis@@ course in geo@@ engineering about whether you should have that available , if things go faster , or that innovation takes longer , or that innovation takes longer than we expect . </s>
climate change : do you have one or two sent@@ ences for you to convince you ? </s>
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tics are in very different cam@@ ps . </s>
those of you who make scientific argument are very little . </s>
do you say there &apos;s some negative effects that have to do with the clouds that move things around ? </s>
there &apos;s very , very few things you can tell at all , which there is a chance in a million . </s>
the main problem here is similar to aids . </s>
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot of money to that . </s>
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of pres@@ sing problems to invest in something that you just later have later -- and what happens is that the investment isn &apos;t so clear . in fact , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c report is not necessarily the worst scen@@ ario and there are people in the rich world looking at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and saying , okay , this is not a big dra@@ ma . </s>
the fact is that that un@@ certainty should worry about us . </s>
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and at the same time , elimin@@ ate co2 , then the skep@@ tics say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not interested in that it &apos;s not going to be co2 , i wish it &apos;s going to do it , but i &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot; </s>
and this would be your answer to the b@@ j@@ ing@@ n l@@ om@@ bor@@ g that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals underneath , the poverty re@@ ducing , the fighting of malaria , and so on that there &apos;s a dum@@ b waste of resources to invest money , while there are better things that we can do . </s>
b@@ g : well , the actual spending for the research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion dollars more than you do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic . </s>
under the other things , other things shouldn &apos;t suffer . </s>
and you get too big money money , and here you can see reas@@ onable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic economic , and trying to finance that . for me , most of the waste is happening here . </s>
unless you &apos;re very short in front of a cost break@@ through and funded the learning curve , i think we should try to try to do more things that have the potential to be much more expensive . </s>
if the di@@ stra@@ ction that you get , a very high energy cycle , then you can only keep up with the rich . </s>
i mean , any of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle . </s>
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster . </s>
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g thinks about . </s>
now , his new ma@@ ting is now , &quot; why don &apos;t we have the research on this research ? &quot; </s>
he &apos;s still being connected because of his former stories associated with the skep@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural camp , but he understood that this is a very lon@@ ely group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s going to get the research argument now . </s>
and that &apos;s a thought that i think is appropriate . </s>
research , it &apos;s just nu@@ ts , how little it is suppor@@ ted . </s>
bill , i believe i &apos;m talking to almost everyone here here , when i say , i really hope your wish is true . thank you so much . </s>
b@@ g : thank you . </s>
a few years ago , here at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man was a design competition called &quot; the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge . &quot; </s>
and the idea is pretty simple . four teams have to build the biggest possible structure of 20 spaghe@@ tt@@ i , about a meter tape tape , about 1@@ m fa@@ des and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low . </s>
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low needs to be on top . </s>
and , although it &apos;s really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard to work , because it ur@@ ges people very quickly . </s>
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design work@@ shop . </s>
it was a huge success . </s>
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 work@@ shops worldwide with students , develop@@ ers and architects , even with c@@ tos of the fortune 50-@@ 50 company , and there &apos;s something about this problem that en@@ ables deep insight into the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with you . </s>
most people usually start to ori@@ ent themselves on the task . </s>
you talk about it , you think , what &apos;s it going to look like , you know ? </s>
then they &apos;re invest@@ ing in planning and organization , and they &apos;re sket@@ ching and sending spaghe@@ tt@@ i . </s>
they spend most of their time growing up constantly growing structures . </s>
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , somebody takes the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and you put it on top of the top , step back to the top and &quot; ta@@ -@@ da ! &quot; you admi@@ re your work . </s>
but what happens then , almost always , is that the ta@@ -@@ da is going to be a u@@ h-@@ oh , because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low doesn &apos;t make the whole thing al@@ ig@@ ned and collapse . </s>
there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and under the worst places , fresh b@@ w@@ l &apos;s . </s>
they lie , they che@@ at , they &apos;re conf@@ used , and they produce really dr@@ un@@ ky shapes . </s>
and of course , teams who have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da , &quot; and among the best are fresh gradu@@ ates of kinder@@ garten . </s>
and that &apos;s pretty amazing . </s>
as peter told us , it &apos;s not just the highest to@@ wers , but also the most interesting structures of all . </s>
what you might be wondering is : how is that ? why ? what about these ? </s>
and peter says , &quot; none of the kids spend time being boss of spaghe@@ tt@@ i g@@ m@@ b@@ h . &quot; </s>
they don &apos;t invest in power fi@@ ghts . </s>
but there &apos;s another reason . </s>
and that is that b@@ w@@ l students have been trained to find out the right plan , ok ! </s>
and then reali@@ zing him . </s>
and then what happens when you put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low onto the top , you don &apos;t have time , and what happens ? </s>
it &apos;s a crisis . </s>
sound familiar , what ? </s>
what &apos;s different about child gar@@ den@@ ing children is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they build prototyp@@ es , successful prototyp@@ es , always with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low at the top , so that they have a number of times that they have the ability to fix . </s>
engineers recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an i@@ ter@@ ative approach . </s>
and with every attempt , children inst@@ antly get feedback and what doesn &apos;t . </s>
so the performance of working with prototyp@@ es is signific@@ antly -- but let &apos;s see how different teams do . </s>
the average for most of them is about 50 inches , b@@ w@@ l students get half of them , lawyers do a little bit more , but not much , children &apos;s children are better than adults . </s>
who is the most successful ? </s>
architects and engineers , fortunately lucky . </s>
1@@ m is the highest what i &apos;ve seen . </s>
and why ? because they understand tri@@ an@@ gles and safe self-@@ rein@@ for@@ cing ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric patterns are the key to building stable structures . </s>
ce@@ os is a little bit about average . but it &apos;s going to be interesting here . </s>
you get an ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tive admini@@ str@@ ator on the team , you get signific@@ antly better . </s>
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and you see &quot; this team is going to win . &quot; </s>
you can predict this . why is this happening ? </s>
because they have special skills of the process . </s>
they run the process , they understand it . </s>
and that team , which is regul@@ ating , is going to improve the performance of the team . </s>
speci@@ alized skills and process@@ skills and their combination lead to success . </s>
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six that have stable structures . </s>
i tried something a little bit more interesting . </s>
i thought we were going to bring po@@ ker in the same way . </s>
so i offered a $ 10,000 prize for the w@@ inn@@ ers . </s>
what happened to the design of these design students ? </s>
what was the result ? </s>
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure . </s>
if anyone had built an ei@@ ght-@@ inch construction , he would have carried the prize home . </s>
so , isn &apos;t it interesting that high competi@@ tors have a huge effect ? </s>
we repe@@ ated this exercise with the same under@@ graduate students . </s>
what do you think happened now ? </s>
now , they understood the advantage of the prototyp@@ ing advantage . </s>
that &apos;s the way the bad team became one under the best . </s>
they produced the highest construction in the lo@@ west time . </s>
so there are profound lessons for us to do about the nature of drive and success . </s>
you might ask : why would somebody invest in creating a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ? </s>
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help team , to make cars , to make cars , video games , &quot; visu@@ ally . &quot; </s>
and what &apos;s doing is the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low-@@ challenge challenge , it helps you identify hi@@ ding assu@@ mp@@ tions . </s>
because , frankly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low . </s>
so the challenge offers a common experience , a common language , a common language , to build the right prototype . </s>
and this is the value of this experience , this such simple exercise . </s>
and those of you who are interested in you can visit mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ challen@@ ge@@ .com . </s>
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lows . </s>
there &apos;s a ste@@ p-@@ by-@@ step instruc@@ tions there . </s>
they find crazy examples from around the world how people optimi@@ ze and re@@ fin@@ ing the system . </s>
there &apos;s a world record as well . </s>
and the bas@@ ale lesson , i think , is actually a con@@ struc@@ tive sport , actually . </s>
it requires that we all set up our senses , and that we use our thinking opti@@ mal , like our feelings and our doing , in the challenge that lies ahead of us . </s>
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is what it takes us to get us from a &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment . </s>
and that can make a big difference . </s>
thank you . </s>
we like to do that as if we had a machine here . </s>
a big machine , a cool , ted machine , and this is a time machine . </s>
and everyone in this room has to go in . </s>
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now . </s>
and i wonder what you would choose , because i asked my friends a question a lot about time , and they wanted to all go to the past . </s>
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or america &apos;s super@@ star . &quot; </s>
i don &apos;t know . </s>
i &apos;m convinced that you somehow moved to no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , you know , to wonder . </s>
and i understand that . </s>
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say . </s>
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an ad@@ venture . </s>
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward . </s>
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future . </s>
this is the greatest time that we ever had on this planet regar@@ d@@ less of which scale they are : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , opportunities , dec@@ lin@@ ing disease rates . </s>

vaccin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people is success@@ es of the scientific method . </s>
and from my view , the scientific method of trying to do things is to look at whether it works , if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achie@@ v@@ ements of humanity . </s>
so that &apos;s the good news . </s>
unfortunately , that &apos;s all good news , because there &apos;s some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned frequ@@ ently . </s>
and one of them is that despite all our achie@@ vement , one billion people in the world are hungry to bed hungry every day . </s>
that number ris@@ es , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embarras@@ sing . </s>
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to deser@@ ve that world &apos;s th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly . </s>
drinking water , ur@@ able land , rain@@ forests , oil , gas : they &apos;re disappe@@ aring , and they &apos;re disappe@@ aring , and if we &apos;re not out of that chaos , we &apos;re going to move out of this chaos innov@@ ator . </s>
so the question is : can we do that ? i think so . </s>
and i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the land that they live in . </s>
i think we can power the world with energy that doesn &apos;t crash at the same time . </s>
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a wonder . </s>
but this is holding me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me wake up at night -- we &apos;ve never used scientific progress as well as , never , ever . </s>
and we &apos;ve never been able to use it reas@@ onable in the way that we can do it today . </s>
we &apos;re on the ver@@ b too amazing , amazing events on many areas . and yet , i really think that we have to go back hundreds and 300 years before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment to find a time where we have fighting progress , where we &apos;ve tri@@ pled about these things , more fron@@ t@@ ers than now . </s>

so i wrote an article about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that this was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ st &quot; -- why they believed that molecules would move around a particular instead of an acci@@ dent@@ al way to the nature of nature . </s>
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept going . </s>
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist . </s>
we type , we &apos;re rich . we &apos;re going to eat food , that &apos;s okay . </s>
but i was worried about this article , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found it . </s>
and that &apos;s because these fan@@ a@@ tics who made me crazy had no fan@@ a@@ tics what@@ so@@ ever . </s>
these were un@@ related people , educated people , de@@ cent people . </s>
they were just like the people in this room . </s>
and that got me so excited . </s>
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face it . </s>
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress as we used to . </s>
we talk about the el@@ es@@ p@@ el@@ ves . </s>
we &apos;re talking ir@@ onic about this , which is that a little bit of progress , &quot; progress . &quot; </s>
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what causes these reasons . </s>
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes into science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be . </s>
you can just call a few names , and people will understand . </s>
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ hop@@ al , the challen@@ gers , vi@@ ox@@ x , mass destruction weapons , the u.s. pres@@ identi@@ al election . </s>
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list . </s>
there are questions and problems with the people that we thought would always be right . so be skep@@ tical . </s>
ask questions , ask evidence , demand your evidence . </s>
don &apos;t take anything for granted . </s>
but here &apos;s the thing : if you get evidence , you have to take that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that . </s>
and i can say that for the reason that we &apos;re now living in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen before , and hopefully never saw again . </s>
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that brought the autism epidemic with the mas@@ k , mu@@ ff@@ le , and c@@ lon@@ n vaccine . </s>
very scary . </s>
so studies were condu@@ cted to see if that was true . </s>
so studies are supposed to be condu@@ cted ; this is a serious issue . </s>
the data came in . </s>
the data came in from the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no cor@@ relation , no connection , no . </s>
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in an@@ ec@@ dot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we believe is what makes us feel real . </s>
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of docum@@ ents from a government attack that gives us data , and i understand that , i think , we all do that . </s>
but you know what ? </s>
the result of this was a catastrop@@ he . </s>
catastrop@@ hi@@ c because of this fact , the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world in which the vaccin@@ ates sin@@ k for mas@@ ses . </s>
this is sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous , and we should be ash@@ amed . </s>
it &apos;s awful . </s>
what &apos;s happening is that we could do that . </s>
well , i understand that . i &apos;m going to do that . </s>
because someone here has mas@@ ses ? </s>
has one person in the audience ever seen anyone who die in mas@@ kers ? </s>
not very often happens . </s>
doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year . </s>
that &apos;s a lot of deaths through mas@@ kers , 20 per hour . </s>
but because that &apos;s not what &apos;s happening here , we can push it out , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can walk around and make messages of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy from plat@@ ra@@ h , like op@@ ra@@ h and larry king . </s>
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect the cause and cor@@ relation . </s>
they don &apos;t understand that they seem to be the same , but almost never the same is true . </s>
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , which is very quickly . </s>
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k . </s>
he liber@@ ated us from one of the worst minds of humanity . </s>
no fear , no qu@@ ity , child paraly@@ sis , pu@@ ff , disappeared . </s>
the guy in the middle not so much . </s>
it &apos;s called paul off@@ it . </s>
he just developed a ro@@ ta@@ viral vaccine with a few other people . </s>
he can save the lives of 4@@ 00@@ - , 50@@ 0,000 children a year in the developing world . </s>
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ? </s>
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul running around and talking about vaccin@@ es and says how value they are , and that people should just stop to stop . </s>
and that &apos;s what he actually says . </s>
so paul is a terror@@ ist . </s>
when paul talks to a public audience , he can &apos;t tell without ar@@ med gu@@ ards . </s>
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where his kids are going to school . </s>
and why ? because paul made a vaccine . </s>
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccin@@ es are essential . </s>
if you take them , the diseases go back , terrible diseases come back , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening . </s>
we have now mas@@ kers in this country . </s>
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , children will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers . </s>
and they &apos;re not just going to die in mas@@ kers . </s>
what about childhood paraly@@ sis ? let &apos;s take that one . why not ? </s>
a com@@ posite of me written me a couple of weeks ago , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m a little bit of a shrimp . &quot; </s>
no one &apos;s ever said that before . </s>
she wouldn &apos;t vaccin@@ ate their child against children &apos;s paraly@@ sis . she didn &apos;t want to vaccin@@ ate her child . </s>
fine . </s>
why ? because we don &apos;t have children . and you know what ? </s>
we didn &apos;t have children in this country yesterday . </s>
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody in la@@ gos got to a plane this morning , and i &apos;m flying to los angeles , right now , right now , it &apos;s about o@@ hi@@ o . </s>
and in a couple of hours , he lands and he r@@ ented a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastic ted dinner tonight . </s>
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paraly@@ zing disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because this is how the world works . </s>
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not . </s>
we love to h@@ unt ourselves in lies . we love that . </s>
have you taken all your vitam@@ ins this morning ? </s>
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ o@@ xi@@ dan@@ ti@@ um that helps you on the jum@@ ps . </s>
i know you did that because half of americans do it every day . </s>
they take this stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference how often we find out they &apos;re us@@ eless . </s>
the data is doing this all the time . </s>
they ev@@ apo@@ rate their ur@@ ine . they almost never do . </s>
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ani@@ um . </s>
i agree with you all . </s>
dark ur@@ ine . dark . </s>
why do we do that ? why do we do that ? </s>
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharma@@ ceu@@ tical industry . </s>
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system . </s>
and we shouldn &apos;t , either . our health care system is fine . </s>
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people . </s>
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and el@@ abor@@ ate self to us who can afford it . </s>
so , we run away , and where do we go ? </s>
we &apos;re running into the arms of plac@@ e@@ bo industry . </s>
that &apos;s great . i love the plac@@ e@@ bo industry . </s>
but , you know , it &apos;s really a serious issue , because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend billions of dollars on it . </s>
and i have all kinds of little pro@@ ps here . </s>
none of it -- g@@ ing@@ ko , be@@ wearing , e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , che@@ ated , ac@@ ai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it , it &apos;s frau@@ d . </s>
and you know what ? when i say that , people scre@@ am at me and say , &quot; what car@@ es ? let people do what they want . </s>
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot; </s>
and guess what ? they &apos;re wrong . </s>
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the minister of health , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts to mammo@@ graphy , &quot; or some cancer qu@@ ack , who wants to treat his patients with ca@@ ff@@ e-@@ proce@@ d@@ ure . </s>
if you get to that path where belief and magic replace science , you go to a place where you don &apos;t want to be . </s>
they go to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa . </s>
he killed 40@@ 0,000 his people because he insi@@ sted that red bee@@ ps , bone and le@@ mon oil are much more effective than anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs that we know can slow down the course of aids . </s>
hundreds of thousands of un@@ necessary deaths in a country that will be worse than any other disease of this disease . </s>
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have any consequences . </s>
they have they . they always have them . </s>
now , the brain lo@@ west epidemic that we &apos;re in right now is this absur@@ d struggle between the an@@ x@@ iety of gene@@ tically engine@@ ered foods and bio-@@ elite . </s>
that &apos;s an i@@ dio@@ tic debate . it has to stop . </s>
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors . </s>
this is ide@@ ology , not science . </s>
everything that we eat , every ri@@ ot , every bran@@ ch of pe@@ ter@@ sil@@ y , every ro@@ sion , was changed by the people . </s>
you know , there were no mand@@ ar@@ ins in par@@ ad@@ ise . </s>
there were no can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe@@ -@@ mel@@ ons . </s>
there were no christmas trees . we did it all . </s>
we &apos;ve done it over the last 1@@ 1,000 years . </s>
and some of it worked and some of it didn &apos;t . </s>
we &apos;ve gotten rid of what didn &apos;t work . </s>
now we can do it more specifically , and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vitam@@ in a in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives . </s>
you don &apos;t want to do that ? </s>
i have to say i don &apos;t understand . </s>
we rec@@ ru@@ ited engineering foods . </s>
why do we do that ? </s>
well , what i hear is , too many chemicals , pesti@@ ci@@ des , pesti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong . </s>
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives . </s>
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds . </s>
and do you know what my answer to all of this is ? </s>
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it . </s>
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science . </s>
this has nothing to do with science . </s>
it &apos;s right , morality , patent coll@@ ar . </s>
they know that science is not a company . </s>
it &apos;s not a country . </s>
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process . </s>
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re scared of fear , and it &apos;s holding millions of people from fl@@ our@@ ishing . </s>
you know , over the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we are right now . 70 percent . </s>
this investment in africa over the last 30 years has been . </s>
shame . embarras@@ sing . </s>
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them . </s>
and why ? gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food . </s>
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this deva@@ stat@@ ed stuff , like mani@@ o@@ lic . </s>
mani@@ o@@ o is what half a billion people eat . </s>
it &apos;s sort of like a po@@ ta@@ to . </s>
it &apos;s just a b@@ und@@ le of cal@@ ories . it &apos;s fine . </s>
it &apos;s got no nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are doing it in it . </s>
and then people could become the food , and they would not be blin@@ ded . </s>
you wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ? </s>
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ ese pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be beautiful . </s>
and all i can tell about this is : why do we fight that ? </s>
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we fight that ? </s>
because we don &apos;t want to move around genes ? </s>
it &apos;s not about pushing genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals . </s>
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our be@@ har@@ es on bigger food , better food , unique food . </s>
it &apos;s not about rice kris@@ pi@@ es , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be highest time to understand what that means . </s>
because guess what ? </s>
if we don &apos;t do that , if we keep doing something like this , we &apos;re guil@@ ty of something that we don &apos;t want to be guil@@ ty of , high-@@ tech coloni@@ alism . </s>
there &apos;s no descri@@ ption for what &apos;s going on here . </s>
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of us , and we really have to stop it . </s>
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and go into the future ? &quot; </s>
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do . </s>
right now , it &apos;s in the present moment , but we have an incredible opportunity . </s>
we can put this time machine on whatever we want . </s>
we can move it where we want to move them , and we will move them where we want to go . </s>
we have to run these conversations , and we need to think , but when we go into the time machine and we go into the future , we &apos;ll be happy to have that . </s>
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something that the world needs now . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you . </s>
for a while , i &apos;ve been interested in plac@@ e@@ bo effect , and it &apos;s strange that a magi@@ cian is interested in it , because , you know , you look at it as &quot; a de@@ ception , &quot; a de@@ ception to something when someone belie@@ ves just enough to do it . &quot; </s>
in other words , sugar p@@ ills have shown a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in some studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , because the person thinks what happens to you is a pharma@@ ceu@@ tical or a kind of -- in pain management , for example , if the patient belie@@ ves only enough , a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body called plac@@ e@@ bo effect in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
a de@@ ception gets into something because somebody percei@@ ves it . </s>
so , as we understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick . </s>
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that at least since the 195@@ 0s is in every magic book for children . </s>
i myself learned him from the cu@@ b sc@@ out association of the 197@@ 0s . </s>
i &apos;m going to perform it for you and then explain it . </s>
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;m explaining it . </s>
so , look what happens . </s>
the kni@@ fe you can study , my hand you can study . </s>
i &apos;m just going to keep the kni@@ fe in my la@@ zy way . </s>
i &apos;m going to go back to my sle@@ eve . </s>
and to make sure that nothing in my sle@@ eve disappe@@ ars or coming out of it , i &apos;m just going to push my wr@@ ist right here . </s>
in this way , you can see that no time is moving anything , so as long as i &apos;m expres@@ sing here , there can &apos;t be anything in my sle@@ eve or coming out of my sle@@ eve . </s>
and the goal with that is very simple . </s>
i &apos;m going to open up my hand , and hopefully if everything goes well , the kni@@ fe will be held through my pure body magne@@ tis@@ m . </s>
it &apos;s actually so stuck in its place that i can shake it without the kni@@ fe falling down . </s>
there &apos;s nothing going on in my sle@@ eve or comes out , not a fla@@ vor , and you can look at everything . </s>
ta@@ -@@ da ! </s>
now , this is a trick that i often use to spend little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about de@@ ception when you look more closely , even though it &apos;s a very easy thing to do . </s>
probably many of you in the room know this trick . </s>
so here &apos;s how it works . </s>
i hold the kni@@ fe in my hand . </s>
i say i &apos;m going to kill my wr@@ ist to make sure that nothing in my sle@@ eve disappe@@ ars or comes out , and that &apos;s a lie . </s>
the reason i comp@@ iled my wr@@ ist is that it &apos;s the real secret of the illusion of illusion . </s>
because at the moment , where i turn my hand away from you , so you can see from the back , this finger moves here , my time finger , just where he was , where he was , in a position , in a position where he was so stre@@ t@@ ched . </s>
great trick ? </s>
there &apos;s someone in the back , who didn &apos;t have childhood . </s>
so , he &apos;s there . exactly . </s>
and when i turn around , the finger changes his position . </s>
and now you could talk about why this is a de@@ ception , why you don &apos;t realize that there &apos;s only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way it works information is not coun@@ ting , one , two , three , but it &apos;s a group as a group . </s>
but that &apos;s not really what &apos;s going on here . and then i open my hand . </s>
of course , it &apos;s stuck there , but not through the magne@@ tis@@ m of my body , but by a trick , through my fingers , which is now there . </s>
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by re@@ turning me back , and it &apos;s hidden through this movement that the fingers are moving back . </s>
i &apos;m going to take that hand away . and here &apos;s the kni@@ fe . </s>
this is a trick you can do to your friends and neighbors . thank you . </s>
now , what does this have to do with plac@@ e@@ bo effect ? </s>
one year ago or so , i read a study that got me really right . </s>
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing to me . </s>
and what it turns out is that if you offer plac@@ e@@ bo plac@@ e@@ bo in form of a white p@@ ill , it &apos;s just a round of as@@ pir@@ atory lea@@ f , that &apos;s just a round , white p@@ ill that has a certain kind of meas@@ ur@@ able effect . </s>
but if you &apos;re the shape you give the plac@@ e@@ bo plac@@ e@@ bo , for example , for example , in a smaller p@@ ill , and that blue color and a letter to a letter on top of it , it &apos;s actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective . </s>
and that , although none of them any pharma@@ ceu@@ tical -- they &apos;re just sugar p@@ ills . </s>
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill . </s>
what ? it really made me crazy . </s>
but it turned out that &apos;s not the case . </s>
when you take cap@@ su@@ les , they &apos;re more effective than tab@@ lets of any shape . </s>
a color@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , which is at the end of a yellow yellow , is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le . </s>
the do@@ sage also plays a role . </s>
a p@@ ill per day is not as good as three p@@ ills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact stati@@ stic . i &apos;m sorry . </s>
but the cru@@ cial thing is ... </s>
now , the do@@ ses play a role as well . </s>
and the shape plays a role . </s>
and if you want to have the ultimate plac@@ e@@ bo effect , you have to reach the need@@ le . </s>
right ? a sy@@ r@@ inge with an in@@ effective -- a few milli@@ meters of an in@@ cen@@ tive sub@@ stance that you inje@@ ct a patient . </s>
it creates a very strong image in your head . it &apos;s much stronger than a white p@@ ill . </s>
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if you have a proje@@ ctor . </s>
so the fact is that the white p@@ ill doesn &apos;t act as well as the blue p@@ ill that doesn &apos;t seem as well as a cap@@ su@@ le that doesn &apos;t work as well as the need@@ le . </s>
and none of that has really pharma@@ ceu@@ tical tra@@ its , it &apos;s just our belief that we have a stronger effect in us . </s>
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magi@@ cian &apos;s trick . </s>
i &apos;ll take something that is obviously a de@@ ception , obviously , and i &apos;m going to make it look real . </s>
we know from the study that you have to go to the need@@ le when it &apos;s to go to the need@@ le . </s>
this is an eight inch long hu@@ b . she &apos;s very , very no@@ is@@ y . and i &apos;m going to ster@@ ili@@ ze them a little bit first . </s>
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not ste@@ adi@@ ly specific meat . </s>
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood . </s>
i &apos;m now going to stick this need@@ le into my skin and drive through it through the other hand , until it goes down on the other side . </s>
if you &apos;re us@@ eless -- if you fall easy in oil -- i took a couple of friends in the hotel room last night , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and that woman has become almost o@@ un@@ ce@@ ous . </s>
so i &apos;m pro@@ posing if you &apos;re going fast , then you &apos;re going to look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first hot part in the back here . </s>
you can see it in the same way , but you can also see away if you want . </s>
so , it goes like this , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little bit of one . </s>
i &apos;m really sorry . do she get it crazy ? </s>
and now just a little bit through my skin , and on the other hand , again . </s>
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had at the mes@@ h . </s>
something like this . </s>
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ? </s>
so i &apos;m going to show you -- this is one , two , three , four , five . </s>
well , yeah . </s>
i know what people think when they see this . </s>
they say , &quot; well , that &apos;s certainly not so stupid , and it &apos;s not going to be the skin of the skin , just to give us a few minutes . &quot; </s>
well , then i &apos;m going to show it to you . </s>
what does this look like ? pretty good . </s>
yeah , i know . </s>
and people in the back say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t really see that right . &quot; </s>
the people in the by@@ rooms come in now . </s>
so , let me show you a little bit about that . </s>
that &apos;s really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood . </s>
that &apos;s my meat , and i can turn that around . </s>
i &apos;m sorry . when you get miser@@ able , you look away , don &apos;t look at it . </s>
and the people back there , or the ones that later you see on video some@@ day , say , &quot; well , that &apos;s pretty impres@@ sive , but if it was real , it would be -- see , here &apos;s a hole , and there it is if it really was real , it would ble@@ ed . &quot; </s>
okay , let me just squ@@ ee@@ ze a little bit of blood for them . </s>
yes , there it is . </s>
i usually would take the need@@ le out of the need@@ le . </s>
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wo@@ unds . </s>
but i think in this framework here , and with the inten@@ tion of trying to make something real , i &apos;m just going to let the need@@ le in there just go off the stage . </s>
we &apos;re going to meet a couple more time in the next few days . </s>
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much . </s>
everyone is talking about happiness today . </s>
i &apos;ve got some people coun@@ ting the number of books that have been published in &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave it to about 40 , and there was a lot more . </s>
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing . </s>
everybody would like to make people happier . </s>
but despite all of these flo@@ ors of work , there are multiple cognitive tra@@ ins that make it almost impossible to think about happiness . </s>
and my talk today is mostly going to be about these cognitive fall of cognitive fall . </s>
this is true for la@@ y@@ men thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists thinking about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just like everyone else is like everybody else . </s>
the first of these dro@@ ps is an in@@ cen@@ tive to admit complexity . </s>
it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word , because we &apos;re appl@@ ying it to lots of different things . </s>
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we might have limited it , but in the large and all of this is something we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to take the complicated perspective on what well-being is . </s>
the second tra@@ p is a change of experience and memory : it basically consi@@ sts of happiness in his life and happy about his life or happiness with his life . </s>
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both sum@@ mar@@ ized in the idea of happiness . </s>
and the third is concent@@ rational illusion , and that &apos;s the un@@ fortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affec@@ ts well-being without the meaning of being di@@ stor@@ ted . </s>
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p . </s>
there &apos;s just no way to get it right . </s>
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a back@@ -@@ and-@@ answer session after one of my lec@@ tures that co@@ sted a story . &#91; unclear -- &#93; he said he had heard a symph@@ ony , and it was absolutely glori@@ ous music , and at the end of the picture , there was a terrible circle of sound . </s>
and then he added , really emotion@@ ally , that ru@@ ined the whole experience . </s>
but it didn &apos;t . </s>
what had ru@@ in@@ ded was the memories of the experience . </s>
he had had the experience . </s>
he had had 20 minutes of glori@@ ous music . </s>
they didn &apos;t count because he was a memory of memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and memory was everything he had to re@@ tain . </s>
what that really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two types of self . </s>
there &apos;s a living self living in the present and knows the present , capable of experi@@ encing the past , but essentially just the present . </s>
it &apos;s the living self that the physi@@ cian is fighting -- you know , when the physi@@ cian says , &quot; do you mind if i squ@@ ee@@ ze you here ? &quot; </s>
and then there &apos;s a memory self , and the memory itself is the one that &apos;s given the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side and the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that &apos;s add@@ ressed by the physi@@ cian by asking the question : &quot; how did you feel l@@ ately ? &quot; </s>
or , &quot; how was your journey to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something like that . </s>
these are two very different units , the living self and the memory self , and changing the two is part of the diam@@ eter of happiness from happiness . </s>
well , the memory self is a story@@ t@@ ell@@ er . </s>
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately . </s>
we &apos;re not just telling stories if we &apos;re doing stories to tell stories . </s>
our memory tells us stories , which means what we can keep from our experience is a story . </s>
and let &apos;s start with an example . </s>
there &apos;s an old study . </s>
these are real patients who under@@ wear a painful proce@@ d@@ ure . </s>
i won &apos;t go into the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful than this study was done in the 1990s . </s>
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain . </s>
and here are two patients . these are their records . </s>
and you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; who &apos;s suff@@ ered more ? &quot; </s>
and that &apos;s a very simple question . </s>
patient b clearly suff@@ ered . his gut refle@@ ction was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient b , and more . </s>
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients have suff@@ ered ? &quot; </s>
and here &apos;s a surprise . </s>
and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the gut refle@@ ction than a patient b. </s>
the stories of gut refle@@ ctions were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends . </s>
and none of these stories are very de@@ struc@@ tive or mag@@ nifi@@ cent -- but one of them is clear . </s>
but one of them is much worse than the other one . </s>
and the one that &apos;s worse was where the pain was all at the end of its peak , and it &apos;s a bad story . </s>
how do we know that ? </s>
because we asked these people after their gut refle@@ ction , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing all the time ? &quot; </s>
and she was much worse for a than b in memory . </s>
now , this is a direct conflict between the living itself and the memory self . </s>
from the point of view of life , b was clearly a little worse time . </s>
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s worked , and it &apos;s going to really work on the refle@@ ction of patient a by just letting the tu@@ m@@ ble down the tube without going too much on it . </s>
and that will lead that patient &apos;s suffering , but only a little bit less than that . </s>
and if you do that for a few minutes , you can make the living self of the patient a worse off , and you have to make the memory that the memory self of the patient is much better off , because now you &apos;ve given patient a a better story about his experience . </s>
so what does a story like ? </s>
and that &apos;s true of the stories that memory makes us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent . </s>
so what it does is it exc@@ uses a story of tur@@ no@@ st@@ ability , major moments , and end up . </s>
it &apos;s very , very important , and in this case , the end domin@@ ated . </s>
well , the living itself is continu@@ ously alive . </s>
it has moments of life , one by one . </s>
and you say , what &apos;s going to happen to these moments ? </s>
and the answer is really simple . they are lost forever . </s>
i mean , most moments of life -- and i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated that -- you know , the psychological present is for about three seconds for about three seconds , which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a lifetime -- there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 in a month . most of them don &apos;t leave the tra@@ ce . </s>
most of them are totally ignor@@ ed by the memory themselves . </s>
and yet , you kind of get the sense that you should count that what &apos;s happening during these moments of life is our life . </s>
it &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we use while we are in the world . </s>
and how we would use it seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the memory self for us . </s>
so we have the memory self and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different . </s>
the biggest difference between them is dealing with time . </s>
from the point of life itself , when you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week it &apos;s just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the ur@@ ch@@ y vac@@ ation . </s>
that &apos;s not what it &apos;s like to be the memory itself . </s>
for the memory self , a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is barely better than the ur@@ ch@@ y vac@@ ation because there &apos;s no new memories added . </s>
they didn &apos;t change the story . </s>
and in this way , the critical vari@@ able , which is a remin@@ der of itself , is different from a living self , and time has very little influence on this story . </s>
now , the memory itself is more powerful than remember and telling stories . </s>
it &apos;s the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , which is , let &apos;s say two gut refle@@ cts in two different surge@@ ons and deci@@ des which to vote , that is the selec@@ tive one who has memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s going to be selec@@ ted . </s>
the living itself has no voice in that choice . </s>
we don &apos;t really choose between experience . we choose between memories of experiences . </s>
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future as an experience . </s>
we think about our future as the for@@ war@@ d-@@ looking memories . </s>
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of memory itself , and you can think of the memory itself as one , which is sort of the living self by experiences that don &apos;t need the living self . </s>
i have the impres@@ sion that if we do ur@@ lau@@ b , that &apos;s very often the case , which means we &apos;re making ur@@ lau@@ b largely in the service of memory itself . </s>
and this is a little hard to justi@@ fy , i think . </s>
i mean , how much would we consume from our memories ? </s>
that &apos;s one of the explan@@ ations that is given to the domin@@ ance of memory itself . </s>
and when i think about it , i think of a holi@@ day that we did a couple of years ago in ant@@ arc@@ tica , which was clearly the best ur@@ b i had ever had , and i think quite often about how frequ@@ ently i am thinking about other vac@@ ation . </s>
and i &apos;ve probably got my memories of my memories on this tri@@ ple journey , and i would say , about 25 minutes in the last four years , i &apos;d say . </s>
now , if i ever opened up the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in this , i would have spent another hour . </s>
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s for more than one and a half hours . </s>
there seems to be an in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cy . </s>
now , i like a little extreme , you know , as little appe@@ ti@@ te i have on the toes of memories of memories , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight on the weight of the weight that we &apos;re giving experience ? </s>
so i want you to think about an thought experiment . </s>
imagine your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the ur@@ b , all the images are being ev@@ a@@ por@@ ated and you get an am@@ nes@@ ic drug so you &apos;re not going to remember anything . </s>
now , would you choose the same holi@@ day ? </s>
and if you pick another ur@@ b , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self and you need to think about how you choose that conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think about time , you get an answer , and if you think in the sense of memories , you might be able to get another answer . </s>
why we choose to look out at the ur@@ ge that we &apos;re looking at is a problem of choice between the two types of self . </s>
now , the two types of self thro@@ wing two terms of happiness . </s>
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one self . </s>
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ? </s>
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in life of life itself ? </s>
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process . </s>
what are the emotions that can be measured ? </s>
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of happiness itself over time . </s>
if you ask for the happiness of the memory of self , it &apos;s a very different thing . </s>
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives . </s>
it &apos;s about how happy or pleasure the person is when this person thinks about their life . </s>
very different term . </s>
now , anybody who doesn &apos;t dist@@ ingu@@ ish those terms is going to mas@@ k the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about well-being that mas@@ ses the exploration of happiness in the very long way that they &apos;ve been doing this . </s>
the distin@@ ction between the happiness itself and the happiness of the memory self has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate separate bran@@ ches . </s>
the gall@@ up organization has a worldwide change , where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experience , and there was other efforts in the direction . </s>
so in the last few years we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the two types of self . </s>
and the main lesson that we do , i think , has learned that they &apos;re really different . </s>
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that &apos;s really not teaching a lot about how happy he lives and vice ver@@ sa . </s>
just to give you a sense of the cor@@ relation , cor@@ relation is about five and five . </s>
what that means is that , if you hit someone , you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-@@ foot man , how much would you know about his size ? </s>
well , you &apos;d know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certainty . </s>
they have so much inse@@ curity . </s>
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s living their life as eight on a scale scale , they have a lot of un@@ certainty about how happy it is to be with his living self . </s>
so the cor@@ relation is little . </s>
we know something about what determin@@ es happiness itself . </s>
we know that money is very important , tar@@ gets are very important . </s>
we know that happiness is mostly meant to be content with people we like to spend time with people who we like . </s>
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant . </s>
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the happiness of yourself ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing yourself , you will do very different things at the end . </s>
the conclusion from what i &apos;ve said here is that happiness really shouldn &apos;t be seen as a replac@@ ement for well-being . </s>
it &apos;s a completely different term . </s>
well , very briefly , another reason that we can &apos;t clearly think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things that we think about life , and if we actually live . </s>
so if you ask the simple question , how happy the people in california are , they &apos;re not going to get the correct answer . </s>
if you ask this question , you think that the people in california need to be happier if they say , in o@@ hi@@ o . </s>
and what happens is , when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is what we say , in the climate . </s>
well it turns out that climate is not very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even very important to the thinking itself that deci@@ des how happy people are . </s>
well , because the obvious self is responsible , you can at the end -- some people could go to california at the end of california . </s>
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pur@@ sue what &apos;s going on with people who go to california in hope , to be happier . </s>
well , your life self will not be happier . </s>
we know that . </s>
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;ll be reminded of how awful the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o , and you &apos;ll feel that you &apos;ve made the right decision . </s>
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ll give you a sense of how hard it is . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you . i have a question for you . </s>
thank you . </s>
now , when we talked about a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this gall@@ up po@@ ll . </s>
is that something that you can let us share , because you have a couple of minutes left with that ? </s>
daniel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure . </s>
i think the most interesting result we &apos;ve found in the gall@@ up po@@ ll is a number that we had absolutely not antici@@ p@@ ated . </s>
and we found that in terms of the happiness of the living itself . </s>
when we look at how feelings relate to income . </s>
and it turns out that under an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , but it &apos;s a big represent@@ ative sample under an income of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year . </s>
6@@ 0,000 . </s>
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 . </s>
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they become increasingly un@@ happy , the heal@@ thi@@ er . </s>
that &apos;s where we get an absolutely flat line . </s>
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines like this . </s>
what happens is , of course , that money does not raise an experience of experience , but that lack of money makes you miser@@ able , and we can measure that very , very , very clearly . </s>
in the spirit of self , the memory self , you get another story . </s>
the more money you deser@@ ve are the satis@@ fac@@ tion . </s>
that &apos;s not true for emotions . </s>
but dan@@ ny , in the entire american desire , is about life , freedom , the pur@@ suit of happiness . </s>
now , when people get serious stuff seriously , i mean , it seems to me to put everything on your head , for example , for example , in terms of tax policy and so on . </s>
is there a chance that politicians , generally , would take a comm@@ and in a way that would take care of politics ? </s>
d@@ k : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of happiness in politics . </s>
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now , and in other countries , it &apos;s happening . </s>
people are in the process of reali@@ zing that they should think of happiness if they think about politics . </s>
it &apos;s going to be a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to explore experience happiness , or whether they want to explore life rat@@ ings , so we have to take this discussion pretty soon . </s>
how to increase happiness can be very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the memory itself or whether you think about the living self . </s>
that &apos;s going to influence politics , i think , in the coming years . </s>
in the united states , you &apos;re afraid to measure the experience of the population of the population . </s>
that will be , i think , in the next one or two decades , to be part of the national statistics . </s>
well , it seems to me that this topic is , or should at least be the most interesting political debate for pur@@ suit over the next few years . </s>
thank you so much for the invention of behavioral economics . </s>
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man . </s>
i &apos;m jane mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i design video games . </s>
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality as it is to save online games . </s>
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of them , spend more time with play more and more amazing games . </s>
we currently spend three billion hours a week playing online games . </s>
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot; </s>
maybe a little too much time when you think about how many problems we ur@@ ge in the real world . </s>
but in fact , the institute of research at the institute for the future for the future is exactly the opposite . </s>
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most pres@@ sing problems in the world . </s>
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase the time . </s>
i calcul@@ ated that the time it took for 21 billion hours of play a week . </s>
this may seem a little bit off first , so i repe@@ at it , so that if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade . </s>
no , i mean it really seriously . </s>
why ? this image really describes exactly why i believe that games are so vital for survival of human species in the future . seriously . </s>
this is a photographer phi@@ l phi@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o . </s>
he wanted to catch the feelings in games , so he built a camera in front of the players . </s>
this is one of the classic expres@@ sions in play . </s>
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe some of the nu@@ ances in this picture come out . </s>
you probably see this sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , some fear , but also very high concent@@ ration , much dee@@ pen@@ ing into solving a really difficult problem . </s>
if you &apos;re playing , you &apos;ll see some nu@@ ances here , looking up up@@ ward , and the mouth is a sign of optimis@@ m . the eye@@ bro@@ ws show surprise . </s>
this is a player that &apos;s on the ver@@ ge of something called an epi@@ c vic@@ tory . </s>
oh , you know that . ok . pri@@ ma . so we have some players here . </s>
an epi@@ c vic@@ tory is a result that is so much positive that they didn &apos;t even know that it was possible . </s>
it was almost beyond the imagination . </s>
and if you do it , you &apos;re sho@@ cked to actually be able to do that . this is an epi@@ c vic@@ tory . </s>
this player is shor@@ tly in front of an epi@@ c vic@@ tory . </s>
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces in the world around the world when we &apos;re attac@@ king the next century , and the face of the next century is the face of all the jo@@ ints on the edge of an epi@@ c . </s>
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face in real life when we face hard problems . </s>
i call it the &quot; in life i am bad , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok . </s>
that &apos;s me , like i am , &quot; i &apos;m making bad faces in life . &quot; </s>
this is a gra@@ ff@@ iti in my former home at berkeley , california , where i was studying in my ph.@@ d. , why we &apos;re better in games than in real life . </s>
that &apos;s a problem that a lot of players have . </s>
we think that in reality , we &apos;re not as good as playing in games . </s>
and i don &apos;t just mean much less successful , although that &apos;s what &apos;s going on . </s>
we &apos;re doing more in games . i mean good in the context of motivation to do something meaningful , inspired by collaboration together . </s>
if we &apos;re in a playing world , i believe that many of us turn into our best version , any right now , and immediately help to solve the problem , try to solve it as long as necessary to try to do it after the crash . </s>
and in reality , when we fail , when we colli@@ de on obstac@@ les , we feel often different . </s>
we feel overwhel@@ med . we feel con@@ fin@@ ed ; we feel threat@@ ened , maybe depressed , fru@@ strated or cy@@ ni@@ cal . </s>
we never have these feelings when we play games , they don &apos;t just exist . </s>
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph.@@ d. student . </s>
why is it impossible in games to think , and you couldn &apos;t just get it all out ? </s>
how can we trans@@ mit these feelings from play into reality ? </s>
so i looked at games like world of war@@ craft , which offers the ideal environment for collaborative proble@@ m-@@ solving . </s>
and i &apos;ve noticed some things that make epi@@ c sett@@ ings in online worlds so possible . </s>
so , first , when you enter one of these online games , especially at world of war@@ craft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to trust you a global mission , which is immediately inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ous . </s>
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect at your current level in the game , right ? </s>
so they can do that . </s>
you never get one task that you can &apos;t solve . </s>
but always on the edge of their cap@@ abilities , you have to get yourself hard , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ yment in the world of war@@ craft . </s>
you don &apos;t sit around and you twi@@ st . there &apos;s always an important thing to do . </s>
and there &apos;s tons of collabor@@ ators . </s>
wherever you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish up their epi@@ c mission . </s>
we don &apos;t really have that in life that easy , this sense that if you have a finger@@ ti@@ p , employees are willing to be ready . </s>
there &apos;s also this epi@@ c story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do . </s>
and then we get this whole positive feedback . </s>
you &apos;ve heard about &quot; level high and &quot; + 1 strength , &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot; </s>
this constant feedback is not in real life . </s>
when i leave that stage , i didn &apos;t have that : + 1 , and + one crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea . </s>
i don &apos;t get that feedback in the real life . </s>
so , the problem of co@@ oper@@ ative online worlds such as world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying , at any point in the edge of an epi@@ c , that we would rather be spending all our time in these games worlds . </s>
they &apos;re just better than the reality . </s>
up until today , all the world of war@@ cra@@ gers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years trying to solve the virtual problems of a@@ cer@@ oth . </s>
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad . </s>
it might sound miser@@ able . </s>
but to see it in context , 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago , our first pri@@ mate ancestors began to go up@@ right . </s>
so the first exciting pri@@ mate . </s>
ok , so , when we talk about how much time we spend with games at the moment , it just makes sense when you think about the time in terms of the mag@@ ni@@ tude of human development , which is extra@@ ordin@@ arily interesting . </s>
but it turns out , because it turns out that by using this entire time to play , it actually changes what we &apos;re able to do as human beings . </s>
so we develop collective thinking , heart , heart beings . </s>
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that . </s>
take a look at this interesting stati@@ stic recently by a researcher of car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university : the average boy of today in a country with strong play culture takes 10,000 hours with online games to the 21st year of life . </s>
so , 10,000 hours is an interesting number for two reasons . </s>
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours are the accu@@ racy of the accu@@ racy that they spend in school , from the fifth grade to the gradu@@ ation of high school -- if you never miss . </s>
so here , we have a complete parallel education path on which young people learn what it means to be a good player like anything you learn at school . </s>
and maybe some of you have read the new book by mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well , &quot; sur@@ ren@@ der . &quot; </s>
so they know his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours . </s>
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that , if we spend 10,000 hours with the ti@@ ming of any subject to the 21st of the 21 year , we &apos;re going to be able to master it . </s>
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing whatever the most significant people in the world . </s>
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ships . </s>
so the big question is , &quot; what are the player cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ships good ? &quot; </s>
because if we could find out that , we would have never had a human potential before that . </s>
so many people right now in the world are spending at least one hour a day with online games . </s>
these are our master@@ -@@ players . 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily well in &quot; something . &quot; </s>
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily well in whatever . </s>
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet . </s>
the game industry developed con@@ sol@@ es that are saving energy and working on mobile devices instead of the broad@@ band internet , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil can play online . </s>
you expect an extra billion player in the next decade . </s>
that &apos;s what we have in a total of 1.@@ 5 billion players . </s>
so i started thinking about what it &apos;s like to master these games . </s>
here &apos;s the four things i found . first , ur@@ gen@@ -@@ optimis@@ m optimis@@ m . </s>
ok , think of it as extreme self-@@ motiv@@ ating . </s>
ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m is desire to immediately do something , to master a bar@@ rier , together with the belief that we have an as@@ pi@@ ration hope on success . </s>
players always believe that an epi@@ c vic@@ tory is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying to do it , and that &apos;s the same . </s>
players don &apos;t sit around . </s>
players are ma@@ sters in spi@@ ders of social nets . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show that we like people more than we &apos;ve played with them , even when they defe@@ at us miser@@ ably . </s>
and the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone . </s>
we trust that somebody brings time with us that the rules are going to be in fact that we have the same goal and to the end of the game . </s>
so it en@@ ables that to play the growing of bin@@ ds , trust and one . </s>
as a result , we &apos;re building more powerful social relationships . </s>
happy productivity . fantastic ! </s>
you know , there &apos;s one reason why the average word of war@@ cra@@ ft player plays 22 hours a week , sort of like a part@@ -@@ time job . </s>
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we rela@@ x or do nothing . </s>
we know that as human beings , as human beings , we &apos;re opti@@ mal , when we do hard , significant work . </s>
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right job . </s>
and finally , epi@@ c . </s>
players love to become part of a@@ we of planet@@ ary mis@@ sions of planet@@ ary . </s>
this is a back@@ up din@@ ing system , putting it into the right light . you all know , all wikipedia , the largest wi@@ ki in the world . </s>
the second largest wi@@ ki in the world , with nearly 8@@ 0,000 ent@@ ries , is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki . </s>
five million people are using it every month . </s>
they &apos;ve put more information together on world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other subject in every other wi@@ ki in the world . </s>
they create an epi@@ c story . </s>
they create an epi@@ c source of knowledge about the world of war@@ craft . </s>
ok , so these are four super@@ powers that lead to a single outcome . player are super-@@ powerful , hop@@ eful individuals . </s>
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as an individual . </s>
and the only problem is you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real one . </s>
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve . </s>
ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va is a public scientist . </s>
his work is great . he exam@@ ines why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds . </s>
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to be wit@@ n@@ essing of not less than a mass of mass of virtual worlds and online play environments . &quot; </s>
and this is from an economist . so he &apos;s logical . </s>
and he says ... </s>
not like me , i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit gay . </s>
so he says that really makes sense , because players can achieve more online worlds than in real life . </s>
they can make more social bon@@ ds in play than in real life . they get more feedback and re@@ wards in play than in real life . </s>
so , he says it &apos;s completely logical now that players spend more time in the virtual world than in real time . </s>
i first agree , that &apos;s logical . </s>
but it &apos;s definitely not an opti@@ mal situation . </s>
we need to start to turn the real world into a game . </s>
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s back 2,@@ 500 years ago . </s>
there are these ancient cu@@ bes , out of sheep . you know , you know ? </s>
in front of these fantastic game controll@@ ers , there were sheep in sheep . </s>
and that was sort of the first of people developed to@@ ys . </s>
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of ancient gre@@ ek her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you may be familiar with this story . the story of how and why games were invented . </s>
well , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , games have become more precise cu@@ bes in the kingdom of a fam@@ ine in fam@@ ine during fam@@ ine . </s>
there was such a fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ ri@@ cs decided to have an in@@ san@@ e idea . </s>
people were suffering . people were fighting . </s>
it was an extreme situation . it was an extreme solution . </s>
so they found , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , the cu@@ st@@ oms and com@@ mu@@ te a national strategy . in one day , you would be eating . the next day you would play . </s>
and they would be so thri@@ ll@@ ed in the box , because games are so intrigu@@ ing and satis@@ fying , happy productivity surrounded that they for@@ got to forget that there was nothing to eat . </s>
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would be eating . </s>
and according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they survi@@ ved this fam@@ ine by eating in one day and playing the next one . </s>
so , in the same way , i think we &apos;re playing games today . </s>
we &apos;re going to play games to escape the world of the real world . </s>
we &apos;re making games to find everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , and that &apos;s not satis@@ fying what &apos;s going on in real life , and we &apos;ll get what we need to do out of play . </s>
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end . </s>
so that &apos;s the exciting . </s>
now , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , the fam@@ ine was not better , so the king of the king was the king of the game . </s>
they divided the kingdom into two hal@@ ves . </s>
they were playing a cu@@ be , and the sett@@ le@@ ments were allowed to break into an epi@@ c ad@@ venture . </s>
they were leaving ly@@ dies , and they were looking for a new home , and they just left as many people as they had food to survive , looking for the rest of the neighborhood that they could thri@@ ve . </s>
that sounds crazy , right ? </s>
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless dna evidence indi@@ c@@ ates that the e@@ tr@@ us@@ ers , who later created the roman empire , the same dna as the old ly@@ ri@@ cs . </s>
and so scientists have recently come to see that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos;s crazy story really is true . </s>
and ge@@ ologists found evidence of a global cool@@ ing that took almost 20 years to explain what the fam@@ ine might be . </s>
so this crazy story could be voices . </s>
maybe they actually rescu@@ ed their people through games by fli@@ pping in games for 18 years , and then they had these in@@ genu@@ ity and so much about playing with each other that they &apos;ve rescu@@ ed the whole civilization of civilization . </s>
so , we can do that . </s>
we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft since 1994 . </s>
this was the first strategy es@@ p@@ ash in real time the world of war@@ cra@@ tion series . this was 16 years ago . </s>
they were playing cu@@ be for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years . </s>
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epi@@ c game . </s>
so , they sent half of their civilization into search of a new world , so i take my 21 billion hours of play hours a week . </s>
we should be survi@@ ving that half of us spend one hour a day with play until we have solved the problems of the real world . </s>
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world problems ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve been doing in the institute in the institute for the future for the future . </s>
we have this ban@@ ner in our office in pal@@ o al@@ to , it expres@@ ses how we should understand the future . </s>
we don &apos;t want to try and say the future before . </s>
what we want is to create the future . </s>
we want to think of the best possible outcome , and then empower@@ ing people to en@@ force this idea into the reality of reality . </s>
we imagine ep@@ iso@@ de fron@@ ti@@ ers and giving people the ways of achie@@ ving them . </s>
i &apos;m going to show you very quickly three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and create human epi@@ c sett@@ ings in their own future . </s>
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot; </s>
the game is from 2007 . </s>
it &apos;s an online game where they have to deal with oil sp@@ ills . </s>
so the oil scar@@ city is invented , but we have enough online content , and it &apos;s going to be reali@@ stic for you , and you actually live your life without oil . so , when you &apos;re in the game , tell us where you live . and then you get news movies in real time , which tells you how much oil costs , how food is being im@@ pa@@ i@@ red , how transportation is closed , whether there &apos;s a real life , whether it &apos;s true , and you have to figure out how to make your real life , if it &apos;s true , and we ask you to blog@@ ge about , you know , watch videos or photos . </s>
we tested this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been ac@@ compan@@ ied by it over the last three years . </s>
and i can tell you it was a transforma@@ tive experience . </s>
no one wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should . </s>
but if you &apos;re in an epi@@ c ad@@ venture and you say , &quot; we &apos;re out of oil . &quot; </s>
this is a fascinating ad@@ venture to go on . </s>
find out how they would survive . most of our players , in the game , have re@@ tain the hab@@ its of hab@@ it . </s>
so for the next world of the world , we have a bigger , higher goal than just oil scar@@ city . </s>
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct &quot; at the institute for the future . </s>
starting out is the calcu@@ lation of a super@@ computer , that people have only 23 years on the planet on the planet . </s>
this super@@ computer is called &quot; global ex@@ cer@@ pt for sensitive sensi@@ tivity system , &quot; of course . </s>
the call to player , to sign up , we almost made like a jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ mer film . </s>
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ hot movies , where it &apos;s called the &quot; distribution team . &quot; they have the astron@@ au@@ ts , the scientists , the ex@@ -@@ en@@ ters , and just together , they can save the world . </s>
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say everyone is in the movie team , and it &apos;s our job to create the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice . </s>
8@@ ,000 players played the game eight weeks long . </s>
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they google &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct . &quot; </s>
and the last game we get out on march 3@@ rd . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank . </s>
when you finish the game , you get the world bank from the world bank , &quot; social change , &quot; gradu@@ ally in 2010 . </s>
we &apos;re working with universi@@ ties in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , and we have to learn to learn social re@@ designing . </s>
we have a com@@ ic book . we have &quot; level high for regi@@ onal understanding , knowledge integration , sustainability , vision and in@@ genu@@ ity . </s>
i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people around the world , especially in development areas that benefit from being able to assem@@ ble their own social enter@@ pris@@ es to save the world . </s>
so , i get to the end . </s>
i want to ask you something . </s>
what do you think happens next ? </s>
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the world yet . </s>
well , i hope you agree that the player is human resource , that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change . </s>
we have all these super@@ powers , happiness productivity , the ability to kn@@ it close social nets , ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m , and the desire for epi@@ c . </s>
i really hope that we play together together in a significant game to survive in order to survive another century . </s>
and i hope you &apos;re going to design and play with me like this . </s>
so when i look forward to the next decade , i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure about two things : that we can create every concei@@ vable future , and that we can play all sorts of games . </s>
so i say , let the worl@@ d-@@ changing games start ! </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;d like to share with you a little bit about what i wrote a couple of months ago in the writing of an itali@@ an wired . </s>
i used to get my syn@@ ony@@ mous dictionary in writing , but i &apos;ve already done the process of doing the writing , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never be@@ aten in my life , which is what the word &quot; dis@@ abled really means . &quot; </s>
i &apos;ll read you the post . </s>
&quot; dis@@ ability , &quot; hel@@ pl@@ ess , &quot; hel@@ pl@@ ess , &quot; us@@ eless , &quot; sh@@ at@@ tered , de@@ pos@@ ited , en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed , con@@ vi@@ cted , po@@ is@@ ed , po@@ is@@ oned , im@@ po@@ tent , im@@ po@@ tent , paraly@@ zed , paraly@@ zed , ge@@ han@@ di@@ cap@@ ted , a@@ im@@ ed , cra@@ cked out of traffic , re@@ vi@@ ger@@ ated , re@@ stor@@ ative , he@@ art@@ breaking , coun@@ ted , l@@ ush , co@@ ach@@ ing , us@@ eless . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
ant@@ ony@@ m : healthy , strong , powerful . </s>
i read this list of a friend loud , and i had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i just had to go up until , &quot; i couldn &apos;t talk anymore , and i had to keep reading , and i just had to collect after this kind of un@@ folding , and that connected the emotional shock of the emotional shock . </s>
of course , this was a very old , old syn@@ ony@@ mous dictionary , and i just thought the output had to be pretty old . </s>
but in fact , it was a copy in the early &apos; 80s when i just started out with element@@ ary school and started to build my self-@@ portrait outside my family &apos;s family , also in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me . </s>
and thank god i didn &apos;t use a syn@@ ony@@ m dictionary at the time . </s>
if i could take this one seriously seriously , i would be born into a world that someone like me would see as a person whose life can be positive in any way , but today , i &apos;m going to celebr@@ ate the opportunities and ad@@ vent@@ ures that i &apos;ve experienced . </s>
so i immediately set out the online copy of 2009 , and i expected me to find a specific piece of contribu@@ tion . </s>
this is the up@@ date version of this one . </s>
unfortunately , she &apos;s not much better . </s>
in particular , the last two words are brought up under the near ant@@ ant@@ ony@@ m &quot; all &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot; </s>
but it &apos;s not just about words . </s>
it &apos;s about what we think about the people that we describe with these words . </s>
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values . </s>
our language influ@@ enced our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us . </s>
a lot of ancient societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the tu@@ mer , really belie@@ ves that the language of a flight has a huge force because what you &apos;re talking about loud is also mani@@ fest . </s>
so , what do we actually want to mani@@ fest -- a dis@@ abled person or a powerful person ? </s>
you know , just to tell people about a human being ei@@ ght@@ less than a child might be able to scre@@ w them up and give them some ideas to move them around . </s>
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up doors ? </s>
a human who opened door to me was my pe@@ di@@ atri@@ cian at the a.@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in wil@@ m@@ ington in del@@ ta . </s>
it &apos;s called dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ ti@@ ti@@ llo . a it@@ al@@ o american , whose name , as you can imagine , could not pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ce most americans . so , he &apos;s always been called dr. p@@ . </s>
and dr. p@@ . was always wearing very color@@ ed , and it was just for work to work with children as well . </s>
i found the time that i spent in this hospital just great -- to my physi@@ o@@ therapy . </s>
i had to make individual practice infinite times with these thick , el@@ a@@ stic b@@ changes -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscle , and i &apos;ve hat@@ ed those b@@ ands more than anything else . i hat@@ ed it . i didn &apos;t hate it . i hat@@ ed it . </s>
and imagine i &apos;ve even done a five-@@ year-old child with dr. p@@ . , and i &apos;ve been trying to stop these practices , naturally , naturally , without success . </s>
and one day , he &apos;s seen me at one of my studies -- these practic@@ ings were just ti@@ ring and da@@ zz@@ ling -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to cut one day of one of these b@@ ands . </s>
and if you get it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot; </s>
and of course , this was just a simple trick by dr. p@@ . so i do the practice i didn &apos;t want to do with the pro@@ spe@@ ct of five year-old girls in the hospital in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily practice hor@@ ror with new eyes , and it became a new and promis@@ ing experience that became a new and promis@@ ing experience . </s>
and i wonder today how much his vision of me has shaped as a powerful and powerful young girl , and i could imagine seeing myself as one of nature of strong , powerful and at@@ ony man . </s>
that &apos;s just one example of many , like adults in power positions can cause the imagination of a child &apos;s imagination . </s>
but as we &apos;ve been looking at examples of the syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ aries , our language doesn &apos;t give us a room to imagine what we all wish to do : to enable each individual to see itself as a powerful person . </s>
our language goes back to socie@@ tal changes that have been trig@@ ger@@ ed by a technological change in many cases . </s>
from the medical stand@@ point , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red , k@@ ne@@ es from titan and artificial jo@@ ints for aging body that allow people to really use their possibilities and to develop the limits of their natural dest@@ iny to their natural dest@@ iny , not to speak of social net@@ working plat@@ forms , human beings enable their own identity to define themselves in their own way , and to compe@@ te to groups around the world in a way that they choose to choose themselves . </s>
so maybe this technological change is clear because ever , that there has always been a different truth , that every human society can give something special and very powerful , and that the human capacity to adapt is our biggest plus . </s>
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me how to deal with wi@@ den@@ y , and i &apos;m going to offer you something : that sentence never fits for me , and i always felt very un@@ comfortable about answer the questions of people , and i think gradu@@ ally , i understand why . </s>
this phrase with wi@@ den@@ ds lives by the idea that success or happiness depends on the challenge of a challenge , without having to be connected by the experience that my life has been so successful , because i could avoid the possible drop of life with a pros@@ thetic , or how people can see me with my dis@@ ability . </s>
but the truth is that we change ourselves . of course we &apos;re shaped by challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotion@@ ally or even both . </s>
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good . </s>
so , wi@@ den@@ ds are not an obstac@@ le that we need to cur@@ ve to make our lives better with our lives . </s>
now , wi@@ den@@ ties are just about our lives . </s>
and i am ten@@ ding to see vi@@ den@@ ti@@ ties as my shadow . </s>
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s hardly to see , but he &apos;s all over me . </s>
and i don &apos;t want to have the impact of the impact of a human being . </s>
there are wi@@ den@@ ds and challenges , and they &apos;re just all@@ u@@ ct@@ ant , and each person &apos;s going to be different , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to have wi@@ des@@ pre@@ y or not , but how to deal with it . </s>
so , we &apos;re not just responsible for keeping the people who we love to save f@@ ences , but they &apos;re also prepar@@ ing to make good with it . </s>
and we don &apos;t have any fa@@ vor of our kids when we feel that they can &apos;t adapt to it . </s>
you have to clear two things : to one of the medical fact that the medical fact is to be ampu@@ t@@ ated and to the other social opinion about whether i &apos;m dis@@ abled or not . </s>
and to be honest , the only real and last dis@@ ability that i had to point out is that the world is constantly saying , and she could describe me with these defini@@ tions . </s>
in our desire to protect people who care at us , and to give them the cold , hard truth about their medical proje@@ ctions , or even give a pro@@ gen@@ cy to the quality of life that they &apos;re expe@@ cting , we have to find out that we &apos;re not going to make the bas@@ ics that someone &apos;s really dis@@ abled . </s>
maybe the moment@@ um concept , which is just what &apos;s inside of a broken , and how we fix it , for each individual , for each individual a greater dis@@ ability than the path@@ ology itself . </s>
if we don &apos;t have to treat a human , and not all the forces and the possibilities and ac@@ knowledge that we can , in addition to the natural struggle you have to have , another disease , we have to have another disease . </s>
we &apos;re going to de@@ vote a person who has value for our society . </s>
so we need to look beyond the pat@@ ology and focus on all the human possibilities . </s>
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of our in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cy and our great creative spirit , there &apos;s a connection . </s>
we shouldn &apos;t inten@@ tion@@ ate or den@@ y those challenging times , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , nor should we turn them under the car@@ pet , but it &apos;s about recogni@@ zing the wi@@ den@@ ess opportunity . </s>
i may be more likely to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to tran@@ sc@@ end wi@@ den@@ y , but that we &apos;re open to the fact that it &apos;s open to the hu@@ b@@ ble , to grab them on the shel@@ f , also to use a cham@@ ber expression , and maybe even dance with it . </s>
and maybe we &apos;ll be able to see wi@@ den@@ ties as natural , consi@@ stent and useful , and feel like they don &apos;t bel@@ ong to the presence of their presence . </s>
this year we celebr@@ ated the 200@@ th birthday of charles darwin , and when he written about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , pointed out to something very true in human character . </s>
i would re@@ write it like this : not the most powerful of its species , and also not the most intelligent of its way , but the one who can adapt to changes at the best . </s>
from conflicts , creativity emer@@ ges . </s>
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of human beings to survive and to fl@@ our@@ ish is that the fight of the human mind is defined by conflict . </s>
so , again , change and adap@@ tation are the greatest cap@@ abilities of the human being . </s>
and maybe we just know what wood we &apos;re cutting out of when we really get tested . </s>
maybe that is exactly the sense of wi@@ den@@ ess , a perception of the icon@@ ic , a sense of our own power . </s>
we can give ourselves something to ourselves . </s>
we can give wi@@ den@@ ds a new meaning that goes beyond severe times . </s>
maybe we can see wi@@ den@@ ties as a change . </s>
wi@@ den@@ ds are for a change that we haven &apos;t yet adap@@ ted to . </s>
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve added to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal . </s>
let &apos;s see , who is normal ? </s>
there &apos;s no normal . </s>
there &apos;s the normal . the typical one , but not the normal guy , and would you really want to know that poor , gray person really want to know ? </s>
i think it &apos;s not . </s>
it would be great if we could get this thinking pattern of the normal , the strength , the strength , the strength , to make it even a little bit more dangerous , un@@ able to exchange the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills into society . </s>
and what they found was that the members of our society are always challen@@ ged by members of our society : useful and contribu@@ ting to contribu@@ tion . </s>
there &apos;s a hin@@ t that the neanderth@@ als of the neanderth@@ als in 6@@ 0,000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical inju@@ ries have been carried with , and that may have happened because of the life experience in the survival of these people for society . </s>
they didn &apos;t think of these as broken and us@@ eless ; they were treated as something special and valuable . </s>
a few years ago , i was in the city where i grew up in a food market in this red zone in the nor@@ the@@ astern of pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was standing in front of a sh@@ are@@ hol@@ der toma@@ to . </s>
it was summer , and i had shor@@ ts . </s>
and i hear a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot; </s>
and i turn around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is . </s>
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember it . &quot; </s>
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re not going to remember me . </s>
when i first saw her , i pulled her out of her mother &apos;s bel@@ ly . &quot; </s>
oh , that &apos;s it . </s>
and of course , it made click click . </s>
this was dr. ke@@ an , a man i knew just from my mother &apos;s narra@@ tives about this day , because i , of course , very typical , came too late to my birthday two weeks ago . </s>
the doctor for the chocolate diagno@@ sis of my mother was in vac@@ ation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all . </s>
and because i was born without wa@@ ke legs , and my feet were looking for them , and i just had a few toes on this one , and i had some toes on the other foot , which was the over@@ la@@ p , that strangers had to bring the bad news out . </s>
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be as moving as other kids , or that you could never have an independent life , and since then they just pun@@ ched me lies . &quot; </s>
in fact , i found out that he had gather@@ ed newspaper cli@@ ps of my entire childhood , whether i had won in a letter competition in the second grade , whether i was going to go through the pa@@ vement in the par@@ ade of the par@@ ade to hal@@ lo@@ ween , whether i had gotten my schol@@ ar@@ ship or one of my athle@@ tes , and he used this cli@@ ent to teach his students to teach his students , medical students from the ha@@ h@@ ne@@ man medical school and her@@ s@@ hey medical school school . </s>
and he called this part of his kur@@ ge the x factor , the potential of the human will@@ ing@@ ness . </s>
you can &apos;t em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze enough how critical that factor can be for the quality of people &apos;s life . </s>
and dr. ke@@ an said on , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t say anything else , and even if they get a little bit of support , if you leave kids , children can achieve a lot . &quot; </s>
see , dr. ke@@ an changed his thinking . </s>
he understood that medical diagno@@ sis , and how someone goes around with it , is two different things . </s>
and also i &apos;ve changed my thinking over time , if they had asked me when i was 15 years old , if i had swa@@ pped my pros@@ the@@ tics against legs of meat and bone , i wouldn &apos;t have been h@@ es@@ it@@ ant for a second . </s>
i really wanted to look normal at the time . </s>
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not that sure . </s>
and this is what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite that experience . </s>
and maybe this change could happen , because i &apos;ve met so many people who opened doors to me , instead of meeting people who restri@@ cted me or wanted to con@@ vey to me an idea . </s>
see , it really takes only one person to demonstrate how they can mani@@ fest their forces , and they &apos;re through . </s>
if they allow someone to activ@@ ate their own inner forces -- the human mind is so recom@@ men@@ ded -- if they can , and open up a door for someone in a critical moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher for those people . </s>
they teach them to open up their own doors . </s>
the real meaning of the word &quot; limit &quot; is ro@@ ot@@ ed in the word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot; </s>
it means to make something out of one is the potential to ti@@ ck@@ le the potential . </s>
again , what kind of potential do we want to call off ? </s>
in the &apos; 60s , in britain , there was a case study in britain , and in the back days , gy@@ m@@ n@@ asia was turned into total schools . </s>
they call it stre@@ aming tests in the united states , we call it &quot; track . &quot; </s>
the students are being given to gra@@ des . </s>
and the a students are che@@ cked as hard as he gets , getting better teachers and so on . </s>
they then gave up over a three-@@ month period of time with a &quot; exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating &quot; grade , &quot; very well , &quot; they were told they were very smart , and after those three months , they really wrote lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty . </s>
and of course , it breaks to hear the heart that vice ver@@ sa was said to the students , they were just suffi@@ ci@@ ently powerful . </s>
and then it was the same after the three months . </s>
but only those who still were in school -- apart from the students who had fell out of school . </s>
the most important thing about this study was that the teachers weren &apos;t blo@@ wn up . </s>
the teachers didn &apos;t know that anything was changed . </s>
they were just told that they are the one-@@ to-@@ one students , and they &apos;re the students with the note , and they &apos;re just teaching them something and treated them . </s>
the only real dis@@ ability is a mind that has been broken , has no hope of hope . he finds nothing more beautiful . it lac@@ ks our natural , chil@@ dish curious , and our in@@ na@@ te ability of imagination . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
but if we manage to encourage the human mind to continue to hope to hope , to find himself and to find other people around themselves , to be curious and imagin@@ ative , then we &apos;re actually putting our forces positive . </s>
if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new existence of existence . </s>
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by a persi@@ an poet called ha@@ fi@@ z in the 14@@ th century , and the poem that my friend jac@@ ques dem@@ bo@@ is told me , and the poem is called &quot; the god , who knows only four words . &quot; &quot; every child knows god , not the god of name , not the god &apos;s god , but the god who knows only four words , he always says , &quot; come , dance with me . &quot; </s>
come , dance with me . thank you . </s>
how would you want to be better than you are right now ? </s>
so suppose i said that through few changes in your gene , you could have better memory -- more precise , more accurate and faster . </s>
or you want to have more fit@@ ter , stronger , more force . </s>
would you like to become more attra@@ ctive and more confi@@ dent ? </s>
how about living longer in good health ? </s>
or maybe you &apos;re one of those that always ye@@ ar@@ med with more creativity . </s>
which would you like most ? </s>
which would you like to have if you could just have one ? </s>
creativity . </s>
how many people would choose creativity ? </s>
raise your hands . let me see . </s>
a couple of things -- probably about as many creative people here . </s>
that &apos;s very good . </s>
how many would choose to memory for a good memory ? </s>
already , a few more . </s>
how about fit@@ ness ? </s>
a few less . </s>
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ? </s>
ah , the majority . i like to read it as a doctor . </s>
if you could have only one of those , it would be a very different world . </s>
is it all just one-@@ on-@@ one ? </s>
or is it possible possibly ? </s>
evolution has been an on@@ going theme here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the idea of a doctor &apos;s view . </s>
the great gene@@ tic@@ ist in the 20th century , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who also was a communic@@ ant in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , once wrote a phrase , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense of any sense of evolution . &quot; </s>
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the proof of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn out your hearing device , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you the per@@ mission -- and maybe you can take a look at ka@@ thr@@ yn schul@@ tz &apos;s book , which is about being wrong , because there &apos;s nothing else going on in the course of this talk . </s>
but if you accept biological evolution , think about this : is it just about the past , or is it also about the future ? </s>
is it money for others , or is it true for us ? </s>
this is another view on the tree of life . </s>
in this picture , i &apos;ve laid a bus as a center of des@@ pair in all directions , because if you look at the changes of life in life , all the existing ones on the top of these two have had success in evolutionary terms : they have survi@@ ved ; it has survi@@ ved its environment , fit@@ ness and strength . </s>
the human part of this bu@@ eling , far at the end , is , of course , what we are most interested in . </s>
we bran@@ ch from a common ance@@ stry to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago . </s>
in that period of time , maybe there was 20 or 25 distin@@ cts of hom@@ ini@@ ds . </s>
some of them have come and left . </s>
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years . </s>
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the tree of life , but most of the time , the fundamental mechanis@@ ms of our cells are quite the same . </s>
do you realize that we can take advantage of it and use the mechanis@@ ms of a common bacteri@@ um to produce the protein of human insulin , which is used to treat diab@@ e@@ tic ? </s>
this is not like human@@ insulin ; this is the same protein that is chemical un@@ distin@@ ct from what comes out of the pan@@ cre@@ as . </s>
and while we &apos;re talking about bacteria , is it aware that each of us in our gut runs more bacteria than it takes cells in the rest of our body ? </s>
maybe 10 times as many . </s>
i mean , do you think if ant@@ oni@@ o dama@@ si@@ o asked her self-@@ image , do they think about the bacteria ? </s>
our gut is a wonderful ga@@ ined friendly environment for these bacteria . </s>
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s we@@ t , it &apos;s very comfortable . </s>
and you &apos;re going to give them all nutri@@ ents that they might just want to sh@@ y without any effort on their own . </s>
it &apos;s really a mil@@ d way for bacteria , with occasi@@ onal inter@@ rup@@ tions of un@@ intended , je@@ od@@ ically forced to escape . </s>
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they are important for their lives . </s>
they help di@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve food nutri@@ ents , and they protect them against certain diseases . </s>
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ? </s>
are we in a kind of evolutionary equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um in the form of species ? </s>
or are we certainly going to become something else -- something that might even be adap@@ ted to the environment ? </s>
now , let &apos;s step back to the time of the big bang 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first indi@@ cations of living creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-@@ cell@@ ular organisms , maybe as much as 800 or a billion years -- and then the human species , which in the last 13@@ 0,000 years has been forming . </s>
in this vast un@@ finished symph@@ ony of the universe , life on earth is only briefly measuring , the animal kingdom , like an individual , and of human life , a little not@@ ation . </s>
that &apos;s what we were . </s>
this is also the fun value of this talk , which is why i hope i enjo@@ yed it . </s>
now , when i was a ne@@ ul@@ ing at college , i had my first bi@@ ologi@@ c classes . </s>
i was fascinated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology . </s>
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in individual organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell , will continue to carry on into both of these deaths . </s>
but at the time when multi-@@ cell@@ ular organisms showed up , things started to change . </s>
sexual re@@ production en@@ ters the image . </s>
and most importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of sexual re@@ production , the genome is going to continue the genome of the rest of the body . </s>
in fact , you could say that the inevi@@ t@@ ability of death of our bodies in evolution at the same moment en@@ counter@@ s how sexual re@@ production is re@@ production . </s>
now i have to admit when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death of sex -- it seemed kind of reas@@ onable at that point , but with every year , it &apos;s been to my increasing doubt . </s>
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george bur@@ ns who did this show in las v@@ eg@@ as the show in the &apos; 90s . </s>
and one night , there &apos;s a p@@ at at his hotel door . </s>
it opens the door . </s>
in front of him , this is a beauti@@ fully high-@@ d@@ ressed sho@@ w@@ girl . </s>
she looks at him and he says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-@@ sex . &quot; </s>
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the sou@@ p . &quot; </s>
i came to the reali@@ zation as a physi@@ cian that i was working on a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily con@@ tradi@@ c@@ tory , just different . </s>
i tried to keep the body going . </s>
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy . </s>
i wanted to re@@ store the health of a disease . </s>
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life . </s>
evolution is all about the advan@@ cement of the genome to the next generation , adap@@ tation and survival generation generation . </s>
from an evolutionary stand@@ point , they are and i like bo@@ ster rock@@ ets to send the genetic questi@@ oning into the next level of orbit , then to drop out into the ocean . </s>
i think we all would understand the mo@@ od , the woo@@ dy everybody who said , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get in@@ san@@ e through my work . </s>
i want to do it by not ster@@ ile . &quot; </s>
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the lon@@ gest life . </s>
it doesn &apos;t necessarily affect the biggest , the most powerful or the fa@@ stest , and not even the smar@@ test . </s>
evolution fir@@ es the creatures the best way to adapt to their environment . </s>
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success . </s>
on the bottom of the ocean are bacteria that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ l , and by doing so , if you have the hot ste@@ am , if fish were there there , it would be a vac@@ uum ge@@ ar , and you &apos;ve managed to make it a habit@@ able environment . </s>
so , what does that mean when we look back on what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space in evolution in evolution , and especially as we antici@@ pa@@ te to the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a number of possibilities . </s>
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward . </s>
we have reached a sense of balance . </s>
and the reasons for this would be that , first of all , for medicine , we &apos;ve been able to preser@@ ve a lot of genes that had otherwise been selec@@ ted and had been removed from the population . </s>
and secondly , as a species of species , we have con@@ qu@@ ered our environment that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to us , and we adapt to them . </s>
and by the way , we hi@@ ke and cir@@ cul@@ ate and mix so much that they no longer can say that isol@@ ation is necessary , for evolution to find out . </s>
a second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be a evolution of traditional art , of course , of course , by the forces of nature . </s>
and the argument , here , is that the whe@@ els of evolution are slowly ma@@ pping , but they &apos;re in@@ t@@ act . </s>
and so far the isol@@ ation is when we coloni@@ ze as a species of distant planets , there will be insu@@ l@@ ting and the changes in the environment that might produce evolution in natural ways . </s>
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a deva@@ stat@@ ing , intrigu@@ ing , horri@@ fying possibility . </s>
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t just natural , but led and decided from us as an individual in the decisions that we make . </s>
now , how could this happen ? </s>
how could it be possible that we could do this ? </s>
let &apos;s look at the reality that people today , in some cultures , make decisions about their off@@ spring . </s>
they are , in some cultures , choice to have more men than women . </s>
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and family decide . </s>
so if you think that if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to adop@@ t genetic adap@@ tations to he@@ al diseases and prevent the disease . </s>
what if they could make the genetic changes to elimin@@ ate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or reduce the re@@ ducing cancer risk or stro@@ ke ? </s>
would you not want to be able to do those changes in your genes ? </s>
when we antici@@ pa@@ te , these kinds of changes are going to be increasingly possible . </s>
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years . </s>
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars . </s>
the following year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in dr@@ one to four months . </s>
today , you can have a sequence of three billion base pa@@ irs of human genome at a price of about $ 20,000 and within the room of about a week . </s>
it won &apos;t be long enough for the reality that it will be the 1,000 dollars of human genom@@ es , and it will be increasingly available for anyone . </s>
a week ago , the national academy prize for franc@@ is ar@@ n@@ old and wil@@ lem ste@@ mm@@ ers , two scientists who developed independent techniques that encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and des@@ i@@ red proteins in a more efficient way -- which is called &quot; direct evolution ar@@ n@@ old &quot; direct evolution . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
a couple of years ago , the laser prize , sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ a was awar@@ ded for his research in which he took an adult skin cells , a fi@@ bro@@ c@@ ene , and through manipu@@ lation of only four genes that indu@@ ced the cell to go back to a plu@@ ri@@ po@@ tent stem cell -- a cell potentially able to become any cell in your body . </s>
these changes are going on . </s>
the same technology that makes human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that can not only protect themselves from themselves , but also to serve the imm@@ unity of other viruses against other viruses . </s>
believe it or not , it &apos;s an experiment@@ al study in gang of vaccine against influ@@ enz@@ a that has been built in the cells of a spre@@ ad@@ sheet . </s>
can you imagine something good that comes out of to@@ bac@@ co ? </s>
this is all reality , and in the future , much more will be possible . </s>
so , just imagine two other little changes . </s>
they can change the cells in their body , but what if they could change the cells of their des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts ? </s>
what if you could change the sper@@ m and your cells or the new@@ ly fertili@@ zed egg to give your children a better chance for a heal@@ thi@@ er life -- elimin@@ ate the diabetes , elimin@@ ate the cro@@ m@@ op@@ y , reduce the risk of cancer ? </s>
who does not want a heal@@ thi@@ er child ? </s>
and then the analy@@ tical technology , the same motor of science that can allow changes to prevent disease , could also enable us to adop@@ t super-@@ attribu@@ tes , hyper@@ -@@ capacity -- better memory . </s>
why don &apos;t we have the cru@@ m@@ b of a ken of jen@@ n@@ ings , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of the wat@@ h machine ? </s>
why not have the fast muscle fi@@ bers that are going to enable you to run faster and longer ? </s>
why no longer live ? </s>
these are going to be in@@ consi@@ stent . </s>
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t the attribu@@ tes that we want , we &apos;re going to be transformed by al@@ t style to ne@@ o-@@ evolution . </s>
we &apos;re going to have a process that probably requires 100,000 years in the rule , and we can com@@ press it for a thousand years -- and maybe even for the next hundred years . </s>
these are decisions that have their grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , to be able to deal with . </s>
are we using these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , the more successful that is more friendly ? </s>
or are we going to selec@@ tively choose different attribu@@ tes that we want to have for some of us , not for others ? </s>
will we form a society to form di@@ vor@@ y and uni@@ form@@ ly , or ro@@ bu@@ ster and multi@@ p@@ ly ? </s>
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face . </s>
and most of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make that kind of decisions ? </s>
in good , like in evil , and earlier than you might think , these decisions are going to be about us . </s>
thank you . </s>
i want you to imagine now a port@@ able robot , a port@@ able robot that gives you human skills , or another , the wheelchair of wheelchair helps to get up and to go back and get up . </s>
we call it the ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ um at berkeley ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ons . </s>
they &apos;re nothing else than something that they put in in the morning and gives them extra strength to them , and that will increase their vel@@ o@@ city , and that will help them keep their balance on their balance . </s>
that &apos;s actually the true de@@ br@@ is of human beings and machine . </s>
but not just that -- mer@@ ging that and connect it with the universe and other devices out there . </s>
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea . </s>
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers that are carrying about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the question that they should carry more ge@@ ars . </s>
of course , this leads to some major compli@@ cations -- spinal in@@ jury , 30 percent of it -- chr@@ onic in@@ jury . </s>
so we thought we would take that challenge and create an ex@@ otic skelet@@ on that would help deal with this problem . </s>
so let me introduce you to h@@ ul@@ c -- or human@@ -@@ univers@@ ally dea@@ f . </s>
sol@@ d@@ at : using the h@@ ul@@ c ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , i can carry 200 pounds of different terrain for many hours , for many hours . </s>
its flexible design allows you to ho@@ ok up , to war@@ p and to ex@@ tend mo@@ od movements . </s>
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then raise my strength and exten@@ sion . </s>
we are so far to introduce our industrial partners to this device , this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that year . </s>
so it &apos;s true . </s>
now , let &apos;s look at our wheel@@ cha@@ irs of wheelchair , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about . </s>
there are 6@@ 8 million people living in the wheelchair of the wheelchair in the world . </s>
that &apos;s about one percent of the population . </s>
and that &apos;s actually a conserva@@ tive estimate . </s>
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cor@@ d inju@@ ries that have been hit in the flo@@ od of their lives -- in &apos; 20@@ s , &apos; 3@@ 0s , &apos; 4@@ 0s -- and the wheelchair is the only option . </s>
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , which is multi@@ pl@@ ying . </s>
and so , pretty much the only option -- when it comes to a brain , or other compli@@ cations -- is the wheelchair . </s>
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been for 500 years since , as i say , i have to say , very successful introdu@@ ction . </s>
so we thought that we could start writing a whole new chapter in mo@@ bility . </s>
now , let me introduce you to designers that are carried by am@@ anda boxes 19 19 years ago , which had suff@@ ered a spinal cor@@ d in@@ jury that she had no longer been able to walk since 19 years and so far . </s>
thank you . </s>
as i said , am@@ anda is carrying our elegan@@ ce . </s>
it has sensors . </s>
its completely non-@@ invasi@@ ve sensors in the cru@@ t@@ ches that send signals back to our on@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding computer that &apos;s attached here on their back . </s>
here are also batter@@ y-@@ pac@@ ked pack@@ ings , and the motor motor is going to be on their h@@ ills , as well as their k@@ ne@@ es that move forward in this very smo@@ oth and very natural way . </s>
i was 24 years old , and i was in the form of a mon@@ soon pur@@ k tree while a ski ride was paraly@@ zed . </s>
in a fra@@ ction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my be@@ half . </s>
and not long after that , a doctor in my hospital , and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot; </s>
and this was 19 years ago . </s>
he steel every five hope out of my mind . </s>
adap@@ tive technologies have made it possible for me to learn to ski@@ p back , climb again , and even ride with the hands of the hands . </s>
but nothing was invented that would let me go again , until now . </s>
thank you . </s>
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to meet us and to discuss with them . </s>
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for am@@ anda here , and all the wheelchair dri@@ vers , but for everyone . </s>
thank you . </s>
home in new york , i &apos;m a leader of the development department of a non@@ profit called ro@@ bin hood . </s>
if i don &apos;t fight poverty , i &apos;m using the help of a fire@@ man chief for a volunte@@ er of fire at a volunte@@ er trig@@ ger . </s>
now , in our city where volunteers were suppor@@ ting a highly quali@@ fied professional fire fire , you have to be very early on the la@@ dder to be able to mi@@ mic . </s>
i remember my first fire . </s>
i was the second volunte@@ er at the br@@ ink , so i had a pretty good chance to go into it . </s>
but it was still a arms race against the other volunteers to reach the accoun@@ ting capital and find out what our obje@@ c@@ tives would be . </s>
when i found the main man , he just had a very serious conversation with the home ow@@ ner@@ ship , which certainly had one of the worst days of their life . </s>
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the mu@@ d and bar@@ foot under a screen outside of a screen while her house was in fl@@ ames . </s>
the other volunte@@ er who arrived just before me -- let &apos;s call it le@@ x lu@@ ther -- the main man first got to the house and was asked to go into the house and save the dog &apos;s dog . </s>
the dog ! i was a fi@@ er@@ c@@ ely win@@ d-@@ off . </s>
there was some lawyer or a wel@@ fare admini@@ str@@ ator who now was able to tell for the rest of his life that people were going to go into a burning house to save a living living , just because he was five seconds faster than me . </s>
well , i was next . </s>
the main man win@@ ds me up . </s>
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , you must go to the house . </s>
you &apos;ve got to go up to the top of the fire , and you &apos;ve got to get some shoes with this woman . &quot; </s>
i swe@@ ar it . </s>
now , not exactly what i hop@@ ed to do , but i went out -- the sta@@ ir@@ cases , the flo@@ ors , the real &quot; fire@@ men , &quot; at this point , had already been pretty much done with the er@@ rors of the bedro@@ om in the bedro@@ om to get some shoes to a pair of shoes . </s>
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero . </s>
i was wearing my pre@@ y back down , where i met my er@@ r@@ ance on the front door and the belo@@ ved dog . </s>
we put our treas@@ ures out to the house of home , where , not surprisingly , he got a lot more attention than mine . </s>
a few weeks later , the fire@@ wa@@ vel@@ ing got a letter of the house@@ hold in which they took care of the ta@@ pe@@ -@@ out of their house . </s>
one of the most common kin@@ dness of kin@@ dness : someone even brought some shoes into it . </s>
both in my prof@@ ession with ro@@ bin hood and my side prof@@ ession as a volunte@@ er fire@@ man , i am wit@@ n@@ essing gener@@ osity and friend@@ ship at large scale , but i also see the kin@@ dness of kin@@ dness and the pattern of individuals . </s>
and you know what i learned ? </s>
they &apos;re all important . </s>
so , if i look around in this room and see people who either have been able to succeed , or on their way , i want to offer this memory : don &apos;t wait . </s>
don &apos;t wait for making a difference in another person &apos;s life until they &apos;ve reached their first million . </s>
if you have something , give it to you now . </s>
put them in a sou@@ p kitchen , put a park in a park in the neighborhood . </s>
be a ment@@ or . </s>
not every day , we will give us a chance to save the lives of a human life , but every day , the ability to change one . </s>
so they go out ; they save the shoes . </s>
thank you . </s>

i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the progress of humanity . </s>
a place where women are leading the cep@@ tor with sex &apos; hi &apos; saying , and the game certainly determin@@ es the day -- where fun is a serious issue . </s>
and no , it &apos;s not empty or san francisco . </s>
ladies and gentlemen , their relationships . </s>
this is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the congo forest of congo . </s>
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are together with chimpanzees of our clo@@ s@@ est living related . </s>
that means we have a common ance@@ stor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago . </s>
well , chim@@ ps are known for their aggressi@@ vation . </s>
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve over@@ em@@ ph@@ asi@@ zed this issue in the narrative of human evolution . </s>
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the me@@ dal . </s>
while chim@@ ps are led by great , frighten@@ ing guys , the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ society is led by empower@@ ing female female . </s>
they really came up with this , because that leads to an extra@@ ordin@@ arily toler@@ ant society that has not been seen before in leth@@ al violence . </s>
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least known from pri@@ mates . </s>
they live in the dep@@ ths of con@@ gol@@ ese ur@@ ch@@ id , and they &apos;re just hard to observation . </s>
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the actor of a violent con@@ test that has been deva@@ stat@@ ing for decades , and has challen@@ ged as many lives as the first world war . </s>
it &apos;s not surprising that the destruction of the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are also threat@@ ened by the survival of the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s . </s>
so meat and the decline of the tree of the tree is that you can &apos;t even fill a sta@@ di@@ on with a bon@@ o bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- and even there , we &apos;re not sure to be honest . </s>
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden laugh that the trees are dro@@ pping out . </s>
who are these rela@@ tives ? </s>
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have more frequ@@ ent , bis@@ ex@@ ual sex , with changing partners , and so with so conflicts and social cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors . </s>
now , i &apos;m not saying that this would be the answer to all human@@ itarian problems -- because the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s of the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are more than more than the cam@@ a su@@ tra . </s>
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- like people -- love to play their lives long . </s>
game doesn &apos;t just mean child games . </s>
for us , and it &apos;s fundamental to the engagement of relationships and the care of toler@@ ance . </s>
and we learn trust and the rules of the game . </s>
game en@@ han@@ ces creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about gener@@ ating diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections . </s>
and when you watch bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s playing the game , you see the evolutionary orig@@ ins of human la@@ p , dance and ritu@@ als . </s>
game is the ti@@ de that keeps us mu@@ tu@@ ally . </s>
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage right now out of the wild . </s>
first of all , a ball of bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ art -- and i &apos;m not thinking about soc@@ cer . </s>
so here we see a young female and males in a tracking game . </s>
look at what she &apos;s doing . </s>
that could be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; she puts it in the eggs . &quot; </s>
just that i think it really enjo@@ ys him , right ? </s>
yeah . </s>
so sex games are common , both with bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and in people . </s>
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- and this video is really interesting because it &apos;s really interesting , because it shows the idea of the idea that you can play new elements of new elements -- like the ho@@ des -- and also how the game is going to trust both of the time -- while it &apos;s tremendous fun at the same time . </s>
but the game is a form@@ at . </s>
play is a form@@ at , and it can take a lot of shapes , some of which are quiet , imagin@@ ative , curious -- maybe to discover the amazing thing again . </s>
and i want to show you that this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she &apos;s playing peac@@ efully with water . </s>
i think just like they do , we sometimes play alone , and we have the limit@@ ations of our inner and ou@@ ter worlds . </s>
and it &apos;s this play@@ ful curiosity that lets us explore and interact with , and the unexpected wir@@ es that we form are the real nutri@@ ents of creativity . </s>
this is just a little taste on the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s provide us into our past and present . </s>
but they also true a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to rising challenges through larger creativity and dru@@ g-@@ en@@ han@@ ced cooperation . </s>
the secret is that the game is key to these skills . </s>
in other words , play is our adap@@ tive jo@@ ker . </s>
to success@@ fully adapt to an un@@ stable world , we have to play . </s>
but are we going to make the best of our play drive ? </s>
game is not sil@@ ly . </s>
it &apos;s essential . </s>
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and people equally , life doesn &apos;t exist from teeth and cla@@ ws alone . </s>
now , when it doesn &apos;t seem to be appropriate , game may be the most important thing . </s>
and so , my pri@@ mate mates , let &apos;s hu@@ g this gift to this gift of evolution and play together as we re@@ discover the creativity of the cr@@ ony and the wonder . </s>
thank you . </s>
i want you to imagine two pa@@ irs in the mid@@ 197@@ 9 , the same moment , at the same moment , each of which is a baby -- okay . </s>
so two pa@@ irs , each one of them is a baby . </s>
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time thinking , because if you present yourself all the time , you won &apos;t listen to me all the time . </s>
just think about that for a moment . </s>
and in this scen@@ ario , you can imagine that in one case , the sper@@ m is carrying a y ch@@ om@@ o@@ so@@ m that hits the x chromo@@ some of the ice cell . </s>
and in the other case , the sper@@ m has a x chromo@@ some that hits the x chromo@@ some of the ice cell . </s>
both of them are survival , both light bul@@ bs . </s>
we &apos;ll go back to these people later . </s>
so most of my activities i have two hat@@ s . </s>
i &apos;m working under a hat with the history of anatom@@ y . </s>
i &apos;m a study histor@@ ian , and in this case , i study how people went to anatom@@ y -- meaning human body , animal body -- how they went to body flu@@ ids with body concepts ; how they think about bodies about body . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
the other hat i carried in my work is the activ@@ ist , as a patient lawyer -- or , as i say , as an im@@ patient lawyer -- of people who are patients of doctors . </s>
in this case , i worked with people who have the body guys asking the social nor@@ ms . </s>
so for example , i worked with people who are si@@ am@@ es@@ ian tw@@ ins , two people in a body . </s>
i worked with people who worked on tent -- so people who were smaller than usual . </s>
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with inter@@ sex@@ ent people whose gender is at@@ yp@@ ical -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female body types . </s>
and as a general term , we can use the word &quot; inter@@ sexu@@ ality . &quot; </s>
inter@@ sexu@@ ality is in many different forms . </s>
i &apos;m just going to give you a couple of examples of the possible types of sex types that don &apos;t represent the male or female standard . </s>
in one case , you might have someone with a x@@ y basis , and the s@@ ry gene of y ch@@ om@@ o@@ som@@ s takes the proto@@ gon@@ da , which we all have fe@@ tal stage , growing up . </s>
and that &apos;s why they &apos;re giving te@@ stes at the fe@@ tal stage te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one . </s>
but because this individual is missing the re@@ cep@@ tors to see te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t react to te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one . </s>
and that &apos;s called and@@ ro@@ gene re@@ cep@@ tor defe@@ ct . </s>
so a lot of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no response to that . </s>
as a result , the body develop@@ s more of the typical female trend . </s>
when the child is born , she looks like a girl . </s>
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as girls . </s>
but it takes most of them to reach pu@@ ber@@ ty and grow their brea@@ sts and develop their brea@@ sts , but they don &apos;t get their period , until someone point out that there &apos;s something different here . </s>
and they &apos;re doing some tests , and they find that instead of iron and u@@ ter@@ us , it actually has te@@ sti@@ cles in it and that she has an y chromo@@ some . </s>
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could think that person can actually be male , but they &apos;re not really . </s>
women , like men , have something called ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine gl@@ ands . </s>
they are in the back part of our bodies . </s>
and the side ki@@ d@@ ne@@ ys make and@@ ro@@ gens , which are vi@@ ri@@ li@@ zing hor@@ mon@@ es . </s>
most women , like i do -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosom@@ es , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like i actually talk to and@@ ro@@ gens . </s>
we make and@@ ro@@ gen and we talk to and@@ ro@@ gens . </s>
the result is that somebody like me actually has a brain that was exposed to more and@@ ro@@ id than a woman who was born with ho@@ sti@@ le and has a and@@ ro@@ gen@@ ic re@@ cep@@ tor defe@@ ct . </s>
so gender is really complicated ; inter@@ sex@@ ent is not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can spread across the range of band@@ wid@@ th . </s>
another example : a couple of years ago i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , and he was raised , he had a friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , lived as a man , and he had just found out that he had an egg and a u@@ ter@@ us . </s>
he had an extreme form of an in@@ na@@ te side bla@@ dder hyper@@ -@@ bla@@ dder . </s>
he got x@@ x chromo@@ some , and in the wom@@ b , his side was so stron@@ g@@ ly active to have created a male hormone environment . </s>
and as a result , his gen@@ it@@ alia was shaped male , his brain was exposed to the typical male part of the hormone spectrum . </s>
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one &apos;s ever seen anything . </s>
and it was only when he was 19 , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he surrounded it in down@@ town that the doctors found that he was in the inter@@ ior of being female . </s>
okay , just a quick example of a vari@@ ant of inter@@ sexu@@ ality . </s>
some people with x@@ x chromosom@@ es develop something called o@@ kap@@ est@@ est@@ is , where o@@ vari@@ an tissue is covered by ho@@ sti@@ le tissue . </s>
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening . </s>
so gender can occur in many different var@@ ie@@ ties . </s>
the reason children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s d@@ war@@ ning or si@@ am@@ es@@ ian tw@@ ins , whether it &apos;s inter@@ sex@@ ually -- surge@@ ons are often adap@@ ted to the nor@@ ms , because that would be the benefit for their physical health . </s>
in many cases , these people are completely healthy . </s>
the reason why they often have different types of sur@@ gical interven@@ tions in them is because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories . </s>
typically , our system is based on the idea that a particular anatom@@ y is inv@@ aded with one particular identity . </s>
so we have the concept of being a woman means having a female identity ; being a black person is , sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly , to have an african anatom@@ y in terms of their own story . </s>
so , we have this terri@@ fying idea . </s>
and when we &apos;re con@@ fron@@ ted with a body that &apos;s actually very different for us , it conf@@ ers us in terms of these categ@@ ori@@ zations . </s>
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individu@@ alism in our culture . </s>
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of individu@@ alism . </s>
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , the two people in the body are born . </s>
where i had seen most of my exc@@ it@@ ement recently was south african run@@ ner ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya last year , whose gender was asked in the body of the world cup of world cup in berlin . </s>
a lot of journ@@ alists came up with me to say , &quot; what are you going to do to tell us if ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is female or male ? &quot; </s>
and i had to explain to the journalist that there was no such thing as this test . </s>
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature for us doesn &apos;t have a line between male and female , or between male and inter@@ sex@@ is@@ hab@@ le and female and inter@@ sex@@ is@@ hab@@ le , we are the ones that give them the line of separ@@ ation as natural . </s>
so we have such a situation where , as we continue to continue science , we need to care more about that these categ@@ ories that we thought were stable for stable anatom@@ ic categ@@ ories , which made very simple arr@@ ange@@ ments to create permanent identity at@@ titudes , much more un@@ can@@ ny than we &apos;ve taken . </s>
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender . </s>
it &apos;s also in terms of ra@@ cing , which turns out to be much more complicated than the termin@@ ology of our termin@@ ology . </s>
in our terms , we go into all sorts of in@@ conveni@@ ent areas . </s>
so , for example , we hit the fact that at least 95 percent of our dna , we have the chimpanzees in common . </s>
what should we do with the fact that we &apos;re mer@@ ely dist@@ ingu@@ ished by you by a few nucle@@ o@@ ti@@ ti@@ des ? </s>
as we move forward to our science , we &apos;re increasingly going to move into a zone of dis@@ comfort where we need to recognize that the dum@@ b categ@@ ories we &apos;ve probably had , probably , too simple . </s>
we see it in all sorts of different parts of human life . </s>
one of the areas that we see for example , in our current culture , in the united states today , is the struggle of the beginning and the end of life . </s>
we have difficult conversations about what a body becomes for people , so that he &apos;s a different right than the fe@@ tal life . </s>
we have very difficult con@@ struc@@ tions today -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- about the question of when someone is dead . </s>
our ancestors used to never have been so hard to fight when someone was dead . </s>
they &apos;ve just kept someone who &apos;s got a fe@@ a@@ ther under their nose , and if they moved , they haven &apos;t bu@@ ried them yet . </s>
if she no longer moved , you bu@@ ried them . </s>
but today , we &apos;re in a situation where we &apos;re going to take people &apos;s vital organs and want to plant them other people . </s>
and as a result , we &apos;re starting to fight the struggle with the really tough question , when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categ@@ ories as it used to be . </s>
now you might think that the whole collap@@ sing of categ@@ ories would make someone really happy like me . </s>
i &apos;m poli@@ tically pro@@ gressi@@ ve , i def@@ end people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous . </s>
to understand that these categ@@ ories are really much more inse@@ cure than we thought it was going to be ten@@ aci@@ ous . </s>
and i &apos;m excited about consider@@ ation in terms of consider@@ ation in terms of democracy . </s>
so to tell you about that tension , i need to know first that i &apos;m a big fan of fo@@ unding fathers . </s>
i know they were ra@@ c@@ ani@@ zed , i know they were se@@ xi@@ est , but they were great . </s>
i think they were so ta@@ sty and strong and so radical in what they were doing , that i &apos;m going to look at the mal@@ k of 195@@ 7@@ 7@@ 6 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely for@@ gotten . </s>
it &apos;s because of what happened in 17@@ 7@@ 6 with the fo@@ unding fathers . </s>
the fo@@ unding fathers , in my view , were the original anatom@@ ic activi@@ sts , and that &apos;s why . </s>
what she was looking back was an anatom@@ ical concept , and they built it through another , which was radi@@ cally and beautiful , and 200 years for us to make . </s>
as you all remember , our fo@@ unding fathers reje@@ cted the concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was based on a very simpli@@ stic concept of anatom@@ y . </s>
the rul@@ er of the ancient world had not had a concept based on dna , but they had a concept of birth on the right . </s>
they had a concept of blue blood . </s>
they were the notion that people who had political power should have this political power based on the bloo@@ dy blood line from grandfather to son to son and so on . </s>
the fo@@ unding fathers pro@@ ved that idea , and put them through a new anatom@@ ical concept , and that concept said that all people have been created equal . </s>
they ni@@ vel@@ ed the play field , and they decided that anatom@@ ically they were coun@@ ting , not the differences , and that was very radical . </s>
now they made that part because they were part of an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ing system in which two things grew together . </s>
democracy grew in , but at the same time the science was growing up too . </s>
if you look at the history of the fo@@ unding fathers , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natural world . </s>
they went away from explan@@ ations of super@@ natural ways , and pro@@ ving things like a super@@ natural concept of power , where the trans@@ mission is based on a very va@@ gue concept of birth . </s>
they moved to a natural concept . </s>
and for example , when you look at indepen@@ dence , you talk about nature and god &apos;s god . </s>
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature of god . </s>
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are . </s>
and as part of that , she was able to give us a concept of anatom@@ ic simil@@ ari@@ ties . </s>
and they really prepared the future civil rights movement in a really wonderful way . </s>
you didn &apos;t think that much about it , but what you did for us was great . </s>
so what happened after that ? </s>
for example , the women who were looking at the vote are the concept of fo@@ unding fathers , saying that anatom@@ y is that anatom@@ y is more important than the anatom@@ ical difference , and said , &quot; that we have a u@@ ter@@ o and ice sticks as difference as difference is not significant enough that we should not have the vote , the right to own the ri@@ ght@@ fully citi@@ zen@@ ship , etc . , etc . &quot; </s>
and women were doing this success@@ fully . </s>
the next thing was the successful civil rights movement where we saw people like so@@ und@@ ler who sp@@ ess about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot; </s>
we find men in the mar@@ ked ro@@ ws of the citi@@ zen movement saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot; </s>
again , people in different skin color compe@@ ting for anatom@@ ic differences in anatom@@ ic difference , again , successful . </s>
we see the same thing with the dis@@ ability law movement . </s>
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the simil@@ ari@@ ties , we need to start asking why we keep up with certain distin@@ ctions . </s>
well , wel@@ fare , i &apos;d like to keep up with certain distin@@ ctions , anatom@@ ically , anatom@@ ically , in our culture . </s>
so , for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish to the same rights as a human . </s>
i don &apos;t want us to take away from the anatom@@ y of anatom@@ y . </s>
i don &apos;t want to say that five year-olds have to have the right to get their understanding of sex or to mar@@ ry . </s>
so there &apos;s some anatom@@ ic separ@@ ations that make sense to me , and that we think should be kept . </s>
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep it , and whether they &apos;re meaningful . </s>
so , let &apos;s move back to these two creatures that are been seen at the beginning of the talk . </s>
we have two creatures , both in the middle 197@@ 9 , on the same day . </s>
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , mar@@ ia , three months were born , so she was born on june 1 , 1980 . </s>
h@@ ein@@ rich , on the other hand , is born to the birthday ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment , so he was born at the 1 march in 1980 . </s>
just because of the fact that mar@@ ia was born three months ago , they acqui@@ red all sorts of rights three months from h@@ ein@@ rich -- to have the right sex to have the right to choose the right to drink . </s>
h@@ ein@@ rich needs to wait for all this , not because he &apos;s actually having another biological age , just because of the time of his birth . </s>
we find other od@@ ds in terms of what their rights are . </s>
h@@ ein@@ rich , because you assume that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s at x@@ y -- because you assume that it &apos;s male , it can now be trained , which mar@@ ia has not to worry about . </s>
but in fact , mar@@ ia in all states can &apos;t perceive the same right that h@@ ein@@ rich has in all states , and that &apos;s to mar@@ ry the right . </s>
h@@ ein@@ rich can mar@@ ry a woman in every state , but mar@@ ia can only mar@@ ry a woman in a few states today . </s>
so we have these continu@@ ous anatom@@ ic categ@@ ories that are proble@@ matic and questi@@ onable in many ways . </s>
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do since our science is making such advan@@ ces in the field of anatom@@ y that we have to get to the point where we need to admit that a democracy is based on anatom@@ y ? </s>
i don &apos;t want to give science to science , but at the same time , it feels like science makes itself all the time . </s>
so where do we go ? </s>
it seems like our culture takes a sort of pra@@ g@@ matic post@@ ure : &quot; well , we need to draw a line somewhere , so we &apos;ll pull it somewhere . &quot; </s>
but a lot of people start in a very strange position . </s>
so for instance , texas was decided to mar@@ ry a man that you didn &apos;t have y chromo@@ some , and to mar@@ ry a woman , you have an y chromo@@ some . </s>
now , in practice , people don &apos;t test on their chromo@@ some . </s>
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i &apos;m starting to tell you about the and@@ ro@@ gen@@ ic defe@@ ct . </s>
if we look at one of the fo@@ unding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin lu@@ ther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream , &quot; a kind of solution . </s>
he says we shouldn &apos;t be jud@@ ged by &quot; their skin color , &quot; but the quality of your character &apos;s quality , and it &apos;s all about anatom@@ y . </s>
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot; </s>
but how do you do that in practice ? </s>
how do you ass@@ ess people based on their tra@@ its ? </s>
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be given rights to people in terms of people , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden re@@ tri@@ ever@@ s that probably make social offi@@ ci@@ als more likely than some people i know . </s>
i want to say that i probably know some bright lab@@ ra@@ bby dogs , more capable of meeting more more sophisticated , more intelligent and more ri@@ gor@@ ous decisions about their sexual relationships than some 4@@ 0-@@ year-old i know about . </s>
so how do we control the question of the characteristics of character ? </s>
it turns out to be really difficult . </s>
and part of me wonder , what if the content of a personality was something that could be machin@@ e-@@ read@@ able in the future -- could be made visible by f@@ mri ? </s>
do we really want to go that way ? </s>
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going . </s>
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to thinking about asking questions about questions about the question of democracy . </s>
in our efforts for democracy , we &apos;ve done it really well , and i think we would do well in the future of the future . </s>
we don &apos;t have the situation , like in iran , in iran , where a man who feels sex@@ ually attra@@ cted to other men is to death with death , unless he is willing to teach a gender transformation in which case he can stay alive . </s>
we don &apos;t exist in these sorts of things . </s>
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon that i spoke to a couple of years ago , who had brought a few si@@ ze@@ ese tw@@ ins to separate them , par@@ tly to make a name , par@@ tly . </s>
but when i was working with him , and asked him why he did these interven@@ tions -- it was high-@@ ris@@ ky sur@@ ger@@ ies -- was his answer that , in his country , these children would be treated very bad@@ ly , and that &apos;s why he had to do it . </s>
and i said to him , &quot; now , you &apos;ve moved political as@@ y@@ l in consider@@ ation instead of an operation to separate them ? &quot; </s>
the united states offer incredible opportunities to allow people who are , without having to change around the state of the state . </s>
that &apos;s why i think we have to be leaders . </s>
well , just to conclude , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about da@@ ds . </s>
and i want to think about the possibilities of how democracy might look , or if we could have looked at the mothers if we had more involved in the mothers . </s>
and i want to say something that is radical for a femin@@ ist , and that is , i think , that there could be different types of insi@@ ghts that gover@@ n by different kinds of anatom@@ y , especially when people are using a group of groups . </s>
for years , because i was interested in inter@@ sexu@@ ality , i &apos;ve also been interested in this research in gender . </s>
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world . </s>
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural studies is that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- more often complex social relationships and care for people who are vulnerable within the group are a lot of attention . </s>
and that &apos;s why , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us . </s>
years ago , when i was making a graduate student , one of my students who had been interested in my interest in femin@@ ism -- i was looking at myself as a femin@@ ist , so i was still doing it -- a really curious question . </s>
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s female about femin@@ ism . &quot; </s>
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the most stupid question i &apos;ve ever heard . </s>
femin@@ ism is about solving stereot@@ yp@@ es about gender , that &apos;s why femin@@ ism is not female . </s>
but the more i thought about his question , more and more , i thought , that there could be some female in femin@@ ism . </s>
that is to say , there could be something on average , on average , which female brains are different from male , which makes us more sensitive to highly complex social relationships and more attention to the shi@@ eld needs . </s>
so , where the fo@@ unding fathers were extremely consider@@ able to find out how individuals are protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers into this concept , we have more a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other . </s>
and maybe that &apos;s where we have to go into the future when we get out of democracy on anatom@@ y -- less about the individual body to think about what identity is about , and more about relationships . </s>
so that as people try to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other . </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case . </s>
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got , i &apos;m going to make a very public conf@@ ession , and that is : i &apos;m obsessed with out@@ fits . </s>
i love to find another possibility of finding another color@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit , and also to photograph and blog@@ ging and blog@@ ging through time . </s>
but i don &apos;t buy anything new . </s>
i get all my clothes out of two hand on la@@ p and in mo@@ d man@@ -@@ hand . </s>
ooh , thank you . </s>
mo@@ d hand shopping allows me to reduce the influence of my gar@@ der@@ o@@ be to the environment , and also the influence of my wal@@ lets . </s>
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars for usually a good cause ; i look pretty unique ; and i &apos;m going to buy it to my personal personal search search . </s>
i mean , what am i going to find today ? </s>
is it going to be my size ? </s>
am i going to like the color ? </s>
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ? </s>
when all the answers said yes , i feel like i won . </s>
i come back to my su@@ it@@ case , and i tell you what i &apos;ve pac@@ ked here for this exciting week at ted . </s>
i mean , what is someone doing with so many out@@ fits ? </s>
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with me . </s>
i brought in seven pair of under@@ pants , and that &apos;s it . </s>
sub@@ sub@@ sions for exactly one week are everything i &apos;ve done in my su@@ it@@ case . </s>
i &apos;ve bet that i would find anything that i might want to wear if i first came up to palm spr@@ ings . </s>
and since you &apos;ve not heard of me when the woman who &apos;s here at ted in their under@@ wear -- that &apos;s what i found a few things . </s>
and i really want to show you my out@@ fits for this week . </s>
does that sound good ? </s>
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i believe believe or not , from these ad@@ vent@@ ures , to wear nothing new . </s>
so let &apos;s start with sun@@ day . </s>
i call this the be@@ ating tiger . </s>
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money in order to look great . </s>
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars . </s>
this whole out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket costs me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week . </s>
mon@@ day : color is something powerful . </s>
it &apos;s almost physi@@ ologically impossible to be bad ser@@ ved when you &apos;re wearing bright red pants . </s>
if you &apos;re happy , you make other happy people . </s>
tu@@ es@@ day : adap@@ ting is totally over@@ r@@ ated . </s>
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself and to adapt to myself at the same time . </s>
just be who you are . </s>
if you surro@@ und yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;re going to appreciate it . </s>
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : hu@@ g your inner child . </s>
sometimes people say , i look like i &apos;m going to play d@@ res@@ sing , or i remember her se@@ ven@@ -year-old . </s>
i &apos;d like to s@@ mil@@ ing and say , &quot; thank you . &quot; </s>
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : confidence is the key one . </s>
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , then it &apos;s almost certainly like this . </s>
and if you think you &apos;re not looking good in something , you &apos;re probably right now . </s>
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day . </s>
but only when i turned 30 , i really understood what that means . </s>
and i &apos;m going to sum@@ mar@@ ize that for you for a moment . </s>
if you believe you &apos;re inside and out of a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear . </s>
so there &apos;s no excuse for anyone here in this audience . </s>
we should be able to figure out what we want . </s>
thank you . </s>
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words : golden pa@@ il@@ le@@ te to everything . </s>
and finally , satur@@ day : a very unique , unique way to develop , is a great way to tell the world a little bit without saying a word . </s>
it was pro@@ ven to me over and over again , if in this week , people got to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations . </s>
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny su@@ it@@ case . </s>
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to don@@ ate all that again . </s>
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go . </s>
i don &apos;t have to add these things emotion@@ ally , because the corner is always going to be another crazy , color@@ ful , color@@ ful , radiation out@@ fit that just wa@@ kes me up if i love a little bit in the heart and search for it . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
thank you . </s>
good afternoon everybody . </s>
so here &apos;s something i &apos;d like to show you . </s>
think of this as the ima@@ gery , as a flying point . </s>
this is what we call in our lab , per@@ cep@@ tual design . </s>
let me tell you a little bit about it . </s>
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m origin@@ ally itali@@ an , and every boy in it@@ aly grows with this image in his room in his room , but the reason i &apos;m going to show you this is because i &apos;m going to show you something very interesting in the formul@@ a one over the last decade . </s>
some time ago , if you wanted to win a formul@@ a for a race , you would take your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car . </s>
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race . </s>
now , if you want to win a race , actually something like this -- something that monit@@ ors the car in real time , has some thousand sensors that go on information from the car , and then process that information , and then use it and use that car to make decisions back and change things in real time while information is being collected in real time . </s>
that would you , in engineering teams , call a re@@ al-@@ time control system . </s>
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made out of two parts -- a l@@ ush part and a re@@ acting ar@@ row . </s>
what &apos;s interesting today is the re@@ al-@@ time control systems begin to appear in our lives . </s>
our cities have been equi@@ pped , in the last few years , with networks and electronics . </s>
they become the free of computers . </s>
and as a computer , they start to respond in a different way , they &apos;re percei@@ ved , they &apos;re percei@@ ved , they &apos;re driven . </s>
when we make cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal . </s>
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there . </s>
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of the co2 emissions . </s>
so if we &apos;re going to make something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing . </s>
beyond the cities , all of this sense of percei@@ ving and driving objects into objects of everyday life . </s>
this is from an exhibition that pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i for mom@@ a later in the year , during the summer . </s>
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot; </s>
now , all of our objects , our environment , are starting to come back to us . </s>
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom is out there , a sensor and a dri@@ ver . </s>
and that changes radi@@ cally the interaction that we have outside the environment . </s>
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ... </s>
you know , when mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o shaped the mo@@ ses , it means that he took the ham@@ mer and thre@@ w it on mo@@ ses -- in fact , they can still see a little bit of un@@ ten@@ der -- and said , &quot; per@@ ch@@ é n@@ on par@@ li ? why don &apos;t you ? &quot; </s>
well , today , our environment , for the first time , begins to respond to us . </s>
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of percei@@ ving our environment and driving our environment . </s>
so let &apos;s start with the percei@@ vation . </s>
so the first project i &apos;d like to introduce you to is really one of the first of our labs . </s>
it was born four and a half years ago in it@@ aly . </s>
and what we did , actually , was to use a new kind of network that was deplo@@ yed all over the world -- that &apos;s a mobile phone net -- and anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated information from this network , that &apos;s going to be acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ated from the oper@@ ators to understand how the city works . </s>
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 . </s>
it was as it@@ aly won the soc@@ cer world cup . </s>
some of you remember it played as it@@ aly against france , and then at the end of the end , the head sto@@ ck . </s>
and anyway , it@@ aly won &apos;t win it at the end . </s>
now look what happened that day , just looking at the activity of activity that &apos;s happening in the network . </s>
here you see the city . </s>
you can see in the middle of the k@@ olo@@ s@@ se@@ um , the ti@@ de ti@@ ber . </s>
in the morning , before the game . </s>
you see the ti@@ mel@@ ine up there . </s>
back afternoon , people here and there are the phone calls and moving . </s>
the game starts to start -- silence . </s>
france does a gate . it@@ aly makes an tor . </s>
and half of time , people make a short call , go to the toilet . </s>
second time . end of normal play time . </s>
first exten@@ sion , second . </s>
zi@@ dan@@ e , at a moment of the head sto@@ ck . </s>
it@@ aly w@@ ins . yeah . </s>
well , that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate . </s>
they saw the great out@@ break . </s>
the next day , everybody was going to go to the center of the team and the prime minister and the prime minister at the same time . </s>
and then everyone went down . </s>
you see the picture of the place cir@@ co mas@@ sim@@ o , where , since the tube , people go to celebrate celebrate -- to have a big party , and they see the impact at the end of the day . </s>
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t do a few years ago . </s>
quick quick example of consciousness : this is not about people , it &apos;s about things that we use and consume . </s>
well , today we know everything about where our things are coming from . </s>
this is a map that shows you all the chips where a ma@@ c computer is , how they got together . </s>
but we only know a little bit about where the things go . </s>
so in this project , we actually designed some small mark@@ ers to track the garbage as they go through the system . </s>
so we &apos;ve started with some volunteers , a little bit more than a year ago in seattle , in seattle , to tag the things that they were thro@@ wing away -- different kinds of things that they can see -- things that they would throw away from . </s>
and then we have the little chips , the little br@@ ands , put on the garbage , and we started tracking it . </s>
here are the results we &apos;ve got right now . </s>
by seattle ... </s>
after a week . </s>
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies in the system . </s>
we can do the same things with less energy . </s>
the data was not available before . </s>
but that &apos;s happening a lot more un@@ useful and more complicated things happen . </s>
the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , that the cup that we throw away is not just disappe@@ aring that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet . </s>
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re still thro@@ wing away every day is still going to be there . </s>
and if we were to show that to people , then we can move a behavior change . </s>
so that &apos;s the reason for this project . </s>
my colleague at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , could tell you much more about that , and the many other wonderful things you can make with sense , but i want to talk to the second part that we were discus@@ sing at the beginning , and that &apos;s the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of our environment . </s>
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in zar@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in . </s>
it started with a question of the citi@@ zen master who came to us and said that spa@@ in and southern europe have a beautiful tradition to use water to use water as part of architecture . </s>
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology ? </s>
and one of the ideas that had been sent to work in a work of work , imagine these tu@@ bes , and val@@ ves , magnetic val@@ ves , the val@@ ves that open and close . </s>
they &apos;re going to cause a water pre@@ cur@@ sor to the wat@@ ers of water . </s>
when these images fall down , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text . </s>
and you can approach him , and it will open up to let you go through it , as you can see in this picture . </s>
well , we introduced the ma@@ yor bel@@ hole . </s>
he really enjo@@ yed him . </s>
and we got the assign@@ ment to design a building in the exp@@ o of the exp@@ o . </s>
we called it the digital water pa@@ vili@@ lion . </s>
the whole building was made out of water . </s>
there are no doors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up and let it go . </s>
the roo@@ f@@ top was also covered with water . </s>
and if it &apos;s w@@ indi@@ g , if you want to reduce the inje@@ ction , you can actually let the roof down . </s>
or you could join the building , and the whole architecture of architecture , like in this case , you know , that day when you go down the roof , you get images of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot; </s>
no , they haven &apos;t destroyed the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappe@@ ars . </s>
here &apos;s how the building works . </s>
you see the person wondering what &apos;s going on inside the inside . </s>
and this is me when i was trying to test the testing of the sensors that opened the water , not to be we@@ t . </s>
now , i want to tell you what happened at night when all the sensors stopped . </s>
but it was actually a bigger fun that night . </s>
all the children from zar@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different . </s>
no longer a building that would open up to make you one , but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump now without we@@ t . </s>
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people are using things that we create . </s>
but the reality is always un@@ predictable . </s>
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are being used and interacting with people . </s>
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical ima@@ gery , the ima@@ gery of water and proje@@ ctions on it . </s>
and this is what inspired us to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now . </s>
so imagine these images could really start to fly . </s>
imagine if you could have little heli@@ cop@@ ters that fly through the air , and all of you with a little bit of a small image of light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room . </s>
here &apos;s the video . </s>
imagine a heli@@ cop@@ ter , like the one you saw earlier , moving to others , completely synchr@@ oni@@ zing . </s>
you can have this cloud . </s>
you can have some kind of flexible screen or ads like this -- a identical formation in two dimensions . </s>
or ir@@ regular , but in three dimensions where what changes , the light is , not the position of the ima@@ gery . </s>
they can play with different species . </s>
imagine the screen of the screen could just appear in different forma@@ ts or si@@ zes in different solutions . </s>
but then it could just be a 3d cloud of ima@@ gery that you can walk through and move through that you can see through many , many directions . </s>
here you see a real fl@@ y@@ fi@@ re-@@ controlled control that &apos;s flo@@ wing down the way before it used to form a smo@@ oth v . </s>
when you turn on the light , it looks like this . so , just as we saw it before . </s>
imagine that every single one of people is being controlled . </s>
it could have any single ima@@ gery of a impul@@ se that comes from people , from the movements of the people or the same . </s>
i want to show you something here first . </s>
we worked with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of the best bal@@ let dan@@ cers of our time -- the é@@ rise at the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan theater in new york and the sc@@ ala in mil@@ an -- we took his movements in 3d to use them as a impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fire . </s>
this is where you see ro@@ ber@@ to dance . </s>
on the left-@@ hand side , you see the ima@@ gery , the different in@@ fer@@ ior insi@@ ghts . </s>
it &apos;s at the same time a re@@ al-@@ time 3d scan , and it &apos;s a movement . </s>
so they can be able to complete the whole movement . </s>
you can do it all the time . </s>
but then , once we have all the points , you can play with it , and with color motion , it can play gravity . </s>
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fire . </s>
so i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on . </s>
it &apos;s something we work on for the olymp@@ ics in london . </s>
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud . </s>
and the idea is , again , imagine that again , that we &apos;re putting together the people to do something and to change the environment -- almost as we call it a sky@@ scra@@ per movement , how to move a check of a check , but with a cloud . </s>
imagine that everybody can give a little don@@ ation for a picture . </s>
and i think that the remarkable thing about the last few years , the last decades , is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical world to a digital world . </s>
and this has all di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed , and it &apos;s accessible to the internet . </s>
today , for the first time -- and the campaign of ob@@ am@@ al@@ as has shown this -- we can move from the digital world , from the self-@@ organizing forces of networks to the physical world . </s>
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and make a symbol . </s>
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city . </s>
but tomorrow , it can take us to the next challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we then shift from the digital world to the physical changes ? </s>
so the idea is that we actually invol@@ ve the people in which they do things together , colle@@ ctively doing things together . </s>
the cloud is again a cloud of images , in the same way that a real cloud is a cloud of particles . </s>
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of ima@@ gery . </s>
it &apos;s a physical sc@@ ul@@ ge in london , but it &apos;s covered with visual points . </s>
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences . </s>
you can actually look at it from below , which is the most important moments for olymp@@ ia , 2012 and dar@@ ker , and use it as a kind of connection to the community . </s>
so both of the physical cloud in the sky , and something at the top , they can go like london &apos;s new mountain sum@@ mit . </s>
you can go in . </s>
and some sort of a digital sh@@ ch@@ tower at night -- but most important , a new kind of experience for all of those who want to go to the top . </s>
thank you . </s>
as an artist , it &apos;s very important to me . </s>
through my work , i try to express that people are not separate from nature , and that everything is connected to each other . </s>
first of all , i was in ant@@ arc@@ tica about the ant@@ arc@@ tica of ant@@ arc@@ tica , where i saw my first ic@@ e@@ berg . </s>
i get bor@@ ed with a@@ we . </s>
my heart ra@@ ced , i was s@@ win@@ ky , while i was trying to grab what was in front of me . </s>
the ic@@ e@@ berg around me took 60 feet out of the water , and i just could wonder that this was a sno@@ w@@ fla@@ ke on another sno@@ w@@ fla@@ ke year , year after year . </s>
ice mountains are born as a cal@@ f of a gl@@ aci@@ er or by breaking out of ice she@@ ets . </s>
every ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual personality . </s>
they interact in a distin@@ ct way with their surro@@ und@@ ings and their experiences . </s>
some ref@@ ers to give up and c@@ ler@@ k until the bit@@ ter end end , while others don &apos;t stop and collapse of dramatic passion for dramatic passion . </s>
when you look at an ic@@ e@@ berg , you think it &apos;s easy to think that they &apos;re isol@@ ated , separate and alone , just like we often see people . </s>
but the truth is far away . </s>
as an ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , i res@@ em@@ ble its pre-@@ time atmosphere . </s>
while the ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts out , it fre@@ es out miner@@ al@@ ous drinking water that fe@@ eds a lot of life . </s>
i &apos;m going to go to my footage of these ic@@ e@@ berg as if i &apos;m making portraits of my ancestors , in a sense that they exist in these individual moments of view , and they &apos;re never going to exist again . </s>
it &apos;s not a death when they melt ; it &apos;s not an end , but a continu@@ ous of their path@@ way along the life cycle . </s>
part of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ berg that i &apos;m photograph@@ ing is very young -- a few thousand years old . </s>
and a part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old . </s>
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is a ic@@ e@@ berg that i &apos;ve been celebr@@ ating in ke@@ ker@@ t@@ su@@ at@@ si@@ cs in green@@ land in green@@ land . </s>
very rare , you &apos;re actually wit@@ n@@ essing a rolling ic@@ e@@ berg . </s>
this is where you see it now . </s>
on the left hand side , you see a little boat . </s>
that &apos;s about five feet long . </s>
please look at the form of the ic@@ e@@ berg , and where it &apos;s on the water line . </s>
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there . </s>
that &apos;s the average size of a green@@ land ic@@ e@@ berg . </s>
it ra@@ ces about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters . </s>
and this video is in real time . </s>
and just like that , the ic@@ e@@ berg shows you another side of his personality . </s>
thank you . </s>
my life is really extra@@ ordin@@ arily bl@@ essed by work in some amazing projects . </s>
but the cool@@ est thing i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy . </s>
his name is temp@@ t . </s>
temp@@ t was one of the leading gra@@ ff@@ iti artists in the &apos; 80s . </s>
then , one day , he came back , and he said , &quot; pa@@ ps my legs , my legs . &quot; </s>
and that was the out@@ break of that . </s>
temp@@ t today is completely paraly@@ zed . </s>
he can only use his eyes . </s>
i was facing him . </s>
i have a company that makes design and anima@@ tions , so gra@@ ff@@ iti is inevi@@ t@@ ably a complex part of what we admi@@ re in the art world and look at . </s>
so we decided , tony -- temp@@ t -- and to support his cause . </s>
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money . </s>
what are you going to do with this ? &quot; </s>
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to get to tony again . </s>
i just want to say to him again , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , it &apos;s not -- i saw stephen haw@@ king -- can &apos;t all be communic@@ ating all the paraly@@ zed people through these devices ? &quot; </s>
and he said , &quot; no , just when you get to the higher social layer of life , and you &apos;ve got some remarkable insurance , you can really do that . </s>
and ordinary people are not accessible to these devices . &quot; </s>
and i was like , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot; </s>
anybody saw a film called bu@@ tter@@ fly and do@@ or@@ bell ? </s>
that &apos;s how they communicate -- the way their fingers are running along . </s>
and i was like , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ ic , how can that be ? &quot; </s>
so i came up with the need to just high@@ light a check , and instead i made a check that i had not had the most sli@@ p@@ per@@ y of how i was going to solve it . </s>
i was com@@ posed to his brother and his father , and he was like , &quot; well , my sugge@@ stion is this : tony &apos;s going to talk , we &apos;re going to get a machine , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can make his art again . </s>
because it &apos;s a far@@ ce that someone who &apos;s still carrying it in itself can &apos;t communicate . &quot; </s>
so i was talking to a conference a few months later . </s>
i met these people of gr@@ in , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to proje@@ ct a light on any surface , and then to draw a laser poin@@ ter on it that only regi@@ mes the negative area . </s>
so they &apos;re moving around and doing art instal@@ lations like this . </s>
they say that all the things that are being shown up there are going to follow a life cycle . </s>
it starts with the v@@ ec@@ tors , then the shr@@ in@@ ks come to the bush , after the bus@@ hes , and finally , people do art . </s>
but there was always a life cycle in their pres@@ ent@@ ations . </s>
so i went home , and i ate my wife with my wife , and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way to drive a laser , so that he can do gra@@ ff@@ iti , that would be great . &quot; </s>
that was the beginning of the journey . </s>
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached some things . </s>
first of all , we &apos;ve run the insurance of the doors , and actually have a device for temp@@ ting a machine that he can communicate with -- a stephen haw@@ king machine . </s>
that was incredible . </s>
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call it yo@@ da because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you say , &quot; i &apos;m so un@@ worthy , this guy is incredible . &quot; </s>
mor@@ e@@ over , we &apos;ve flo@@ wn seven programm@@ ers from around the world -- literally from all cor@@ ners of the world -- to us home . </s>
my wife , my children and i are moved into the garage , and these ha@@ ckers and programm@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ racy and the archi@@ sts have taken over our house . </s>
a lot of our friends thought we were beautiful dum@@ b to do that , and that we came back , and all the pictures on the walls would be gra@@ ff@@ u@@ tis . </s>
but for over two weeks we &apos;ve been progra@@ mming , we went to the beach be@@ ating of ven@@ ice , and my children were involved , and we made this dog , and we created this . </s>
it &apos;s called the eye@@ ball , and you can see the descri@@ ption . </s>
this is a cheap sun@@ glasses that we bought at the beach comm@@ and@@ ments of ven@@ ice , some cop@@ per wire and some things out of the building market and the electronics trade . </s>
we took a p@@ s@@ 3-@@ camera , made them apart , put them on a led light , and now we have a device that &apos;s fre@@ ely available -- you can build it yourself , we put the code free , the software can down@@ load free . </s>
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of constra@@ ints . </s>
no insurance can squ@@ ee@@ ze itself . </s>
it &apos;s not hospital either . </s>
any paraly@@ zed can actually actually communicate alone with your eyes or draw your eyes . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you very much . that was incredible . </s>
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back into the tem@@ po@@ ral room . </s>
i love this image , because it &apos;s the room from someone else &apos;s room , and this is his room . </s>
there &apos;s all this bu@@ ll@@ sh@@ al about the great un@@ vei@@ ling of the great un@@ vei@@ ling . </s>
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of progra@@ mming , nu@@ del@@ parties and per@@ pe@@ tual ni@@ ghts , tony drew for the first time for the first time after seven years . </s>
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system . </s>
we &apos;ve gen@@ dered his bed so that he can see outside . </s>
we set up a proje@@ ctor against a wall of the parking lot in front of the hospital . </s>
and he drew again for the first time in both his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a sense that was in the parking lot . </s>
lu@@ ck@@ ily , we had to break down in the parking lot , so we felt right as part of the spra@@ y scene . </s>
in the end , he sent us an email to the following content : &quot; for the first time for seven years , i recorded something . </s>
i feel that i was hit underwater , and finally someone pulled down to the bottom and raised my head , so i can breathe . &quot; </s>
isn &apos;t that mind-@@ blo@@ wing ? </s>
that &apos;s sort of our cam@@ el scre@@ am . </s>
that &apos;s holding us down , and we &apos;re going to continue to develop . </s>
and we have to improve a lot more on this device . </s>
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a magic pan@@ el in the same way . </s>
and someone who has one such artistic potential deser@@ ves so much more . </s>
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger . </s>
since that time , we &apos;ve received all sorts of recognition . </s>
we won a few a@@ wards . </s>
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deser@@ ve it . </s>
it &apos;s all coming from our own po@@ ckets . </s>
so the exc@@ it@@ ement was , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot; </s>
arm@@ strong twi@@ tter@@ ed over us and then , in dec@@ ember , the ti@@ me-@@ magazine hon@@ ored us as one of the 50 best inven@@ tions in 2010 , which was really ne@@ at . </s>
and the cool@@ est thing about this is -- and this includes the whole circle -- that this april mo@@ ca mo@@ ca mo@@ ca in down@@ town of los angeles is going to show an exhibition called &quot; kind of the streets . &quot; </s>
and there are probably pretty much the har@@ dest represent@@ a@@ tives in the street scene -- bank@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y , ca@@ ws -- all these boys will be there . </s>
temp@@ t is going to be part of the show that &apos;s pretty pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar . </s>
so basically , if you look at something , if you look at something that &apos;s impossible , it can be done . </s>
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this micro@@ phone , the eye@@ bro@@ w -- everything was impossible at some point . </s>
do it possible -- all of you here . </s>
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , and i had never had anything to do with ex@@ pos@@ ure technology , but i just wrote something and surrounded me with amazing people so we could put something on the legs together together . </s>
and that question was supposed to be each other every single day in every single day that you would find something that needs to be done , if not now , then when i do , and if not , then , who ? </s>
thank you . </s>
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most wal@@ k@@ able children &apos;s book . </s>
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist like this . </s>
you can have me as a farmer , or in le@@ gend , but no one has ever elected farmers . </s>
today i want to tell you about circles and re@@ vel@@ ations . </s>
well , an epi@@ ph@@ any , usually , is something that you find because you have left it somewhere . </s>
you go around the block and you take it as a re@@ vel@@ ation . </s>
this is a painting of a circle . </s>
and one of my friends has done it -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ es . </s>
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you today . </s>
my circle started back in the back of the high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o , where i was in high school , o@@ hi@@ o . </s>
i was the one who was hit green and blue every week , until a teacher saved my life . </s>
she saved my life by letting me use the toilet in the teacher room . </s>
she did it secre@@ tly . </s>
she did it for three years . </s>
and i had to go out of town . </s>
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 85 dollars , and it hit me to san francisco in california -- i found a lo@@ ver -- and then back in the &apos; 80s , i found a lot of work with aids organizations . </s>
about three or four years ago , i received a call in the night from this teacher , woman po@@ sting , who said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to see it . </s>
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never met each other as adults . </s>
please come to o@@ hi@@ o , please , and please come along with the guy that i know you &apos;ve found in the mean@@ time . </s>
and i should mention that i have pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , and i want you to hur@@ ry , please . &quot; </s>
well , the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and . </s>
we looked at them , we laugh@@ ed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew that they had to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce . </s>
we found one for them , we took them down , and we took care of them , and we gave them eight , because it was needed . </s>
it was something that we knew what to do . </s>
and just as the woman who was learning to me as an adult , she turned to me in a box full of ash , and she was put into my hands . </s>
what had happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and the re@@ vel@@ ation of which i was talking about . </s>
the re@@ vel@@ ation is that death is a part of life . </s>
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her . </s>
and , you know , this part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs . </s>
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so gla@@ d that this is so often mentioned here . </s>
he needs the same -- it needs , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to us to give those things . </s>
thank you . </s>
imagine a great explosion as you go up to 1,000 feet . </s>
imagine a plane full of smoke . </s>
imagine a drive plant , a cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , p@@ ack , p@@ ack . </s>
that sounds frighten@@ ing . </s>
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on 1@@ d . </s>
i was the only one who could talk to the le@@ ap@@ s . </s>
so i looked at her right now , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got some birds caught . &quot; </s>
the pilot was already using the machine , and we were not that far away . </s>
you could see manhattan . </s>
two minutes later , three things happened simul@@ taneously . </s>
the pilot made the machine after the hu@@ d@@ son river . </s>
that &apos;s usually not the route . </s>
it turns off the eng@@ ines . </s>
now , imagine a no@@ is@@ y aircraft . </s>
and then he said three words -- the most mo@@ dest words i &apos;ve ever heard . </s>
he says , &quot; welcome to the insur@@ gen@@ cy . &quot; </s>
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the board staff anymore . </s>
i could see it in their eyes , there was sh@@ y , life was at the end . </s>
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned this day about me . </s>
i learned that in a moment everything is different . </s>
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to make in life , and i thought of all the people i wanted to reach a hand and didn &apos;t do , all the f@@ ences i wanted to fli@@ ck , all the experience i wanted to make and never made . </s>
and while i was thinking about it later , i was saying a saying , which is , &quot; i collect bad win@@ ds . &quot; </s>
because if the wine is there , the person is there , and then i open it . </s>
i never want to shift a little bit more in life . </s>
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , this goal , has really changed my life . </s>
the second thing that i learned that day -- and that was , when we missed george washington bridge , pretty much about hair -- i thought , human , there &apos;s one thing that i really regre@@ t . </s>
i had a good life . </s>
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i pro@@ posed to be better in everything that i pac@@ ked . </s>
but i &apos;ve also given my own ego room in my humanity . </s>
and i took the time that i wa@@ sted meaning@@ less things for meaning@@ less things , with people that mean something . </s>
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people . </s>
and after that , when i was thinking about this , i decided to ban negative energy from my life . </s>
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better . </s>
i didn &apos;t stri@@ ke my wife with my wife for two years anymore . </s>
it feels great . </s>
i &apos;m not trying to be right ; i &apos;m trying to be happy to be happy . </s>
the third thing i learned -- and that is , while the internal clock is starting , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot; </s>
you can see the water coming . </s>
i said , &quot; please , get out of the air . &quot; </s>
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 pieces of how to know it from docum@@ ent@@ aries . </s>
as we fall down , i had this feeling of dying , human being , not terri@@ fying . </s>
almost as if we were to prepare for our lives for a long time . </s>
but it was very sad . </s>
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life . </s>
and that sa@@ dness really formed in a thought , which is that i wish one thing to me . </s>
i just wish i could see my kids growing up . </s>
about a month after that , i was vis@@ iting my daughter -- first gra@@ ders , not a lot of artistic talent ... </s>
... not yet . </s>
and i &apos;m crying , i &apos;m going to cry like a little child . </s>
and in the world , everything had a sense of me . </s>
i realized then by the time , by changing the dots that it &apos;s all about being a great father in life . </s>
more than anything , everything else is my only goal in life to be a good father . </s>
i became aware of the wonder of not dying that day . </s>
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and live in a different way . </s>
my call to anybody who &apos;s going to fly today is : imagine the same thing on your flight -- please not -- but imagine it , and how would you change ? </s>
what would you do that you push up , because you think you &apos;d be there forever ? </s>
how would they change their relationships and the negative energy in it ? </s>
and more than anything , are you the best parents you can only be ? </s>
thank you . </s>

the gray boxes you see here , these are re@@ al-@@ time control systems . </s>
so if we now manage to com@@ press the systems that are controlling the numbers and the val@@ ves , then we can actually create a lot of problems with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge . </s>
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with win@@ dow@@ s ; they are based on a completely different technology . </s>
but if we can create that an effective win@@ dow@@ -@@ virus virus on a laptop is used by a war@@ ning engineer to con@@ qu@@ ure this gray box , we &apos;re in the business . </s>
and this is the planning behind stu@@ x@@ net . </s>
so we start with a win@@ dow@@ s-@@ dr@@ pper . </s>
the user data is trans@@ fer@@ red into the gray box , dama@@ ged cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and the irani@@ an nuclear energy program -- mission leads . </s>
this is a child game , right ? </s>
so i want to tell you how we figured this out . </s>
when we started doing our research at stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the purpose and purpose . </s>
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated what the win@@ dow@@ ch@@ in part , the dro@@ p-@@ per@@ -@@ sharing part , he made by coun@@ t@@ less sh@@ ells of cer@@ e@@ al fire . </s>
and it seemed to have been something , with these gray boxes , this re@@ al-@@ time control system . </s>
and this attra@@ cted our attention , and we started a laboratory project where we infected our environment with stu@@ x@@ net , and we exam@@ ined this . </s>
and then a funny thing happened . </s>
stu@@ x@@ net was like a laboratory rat that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ed , but didn &apos;t want to eat it . </s>
it doesn &apos;t make sense in my eyes . </s>
and after we experim@@ ented with different kinds of che@@ ese , it was a goal for me to do that . </s>
completely focused on a certain goal . </s>
the dro@@ pper stri@@ kes are active on the gray box when a special con@@ figu@@ ration was discovered . even when the special program that &apos;s trying to infe@@ ct it is running on this goal . </s>
and if you didn &apos;t , you don &apos;t do anything . </s>
so , the wo@@ und really was my interest , and we started working with it almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is . </s>
it could say , for example , a us@@ e-@@ american power plant or a chemical plant in germany . </s>
so we should better find out what the goal is . </s>
so we extra@@ cted , and we de@@ com@@ pic@@ tured the attack code , and we found that it &apos;s re@@ struc@@ tured into two digital war@@ heads -- a smaller one and a bigger one . </s>
and we also noticed that they were very profession@@ ally constructed , of people who obviously had all the insi@@ des of insi@@ des available . </s>
they knew any bits and by@@ tes that they had to attack . </s>
they probably knew the size of the machine oper@@ ator . </s>
so they knew everything . </s>
and if you &apos;ve got told that the threat of stu@@ x@@ net is complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you , the user data is a science for itself . </s>
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen before . </s>
here &apos;s an ex@@ cer@@ pt from this ang@@ ri@@ o code . </s>
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15@@ ,000 lines of code here . </s>
it looks pretty much like ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned assembly language language . </s>
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code . </s>
so what we were first looking at was system func@@ tioning , because we know what they &apos;re doing . </s>
and then we were looking for ti@@ ms and data structures and trying to connect them to the real world of the real world -- with potential tar@@ gets in the real world . </s>
so we needed theor@@ ies about these tar@@ gets that we could in@@ spe@@ ct or con@@ temp@@ late . </s>
so to put these theor@@ ies of these theor@@ ies , we &apos;re going to remind ourselves that it &apos;s definitely high-@@ gra@@ zing sab@@ ot@@ age , it has to be a very high-@@ value goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because most infe@@ ctions have been signed up there . </s>
now , in this area , there aren &apos;t many thousand goals . </s>
it &apos;s basically going out to the atom@@ ic force station and the ur@@ in@@ cen@@ tive system in nat@@ ance . </s>
so i said to my assi@@ stant , &quot; get me a list of all experts for cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and power plants from our cli@@ ent tri@@ ps . &quot; </s>
and i called her up and tap her knowledge to compare their expertise with what we found in the code and into the data . </s>
and that worked very well . </s>
so , we &apos;ve been able to connect the little digital war@@ heads with the ro@@ cking control . </s>
the ro@@ tor is this moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , this black object that you see . </s>
and if you mani@@ pul@@ ate the speed of this ro@@ tor , you actually can actually cra@@ ck the ro@@ tor , and eventually even make the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ de . </s>
what we found out also is that the goal of the attack was actually to make it slowly and un@@ can@@ ny -- obviously , in trying to make war@@ fare engineers , so they &apos;re not going to be able to be able to get out of it very quickly . </s>
the big digital war@@ heads -- we got a gli@@ mp@@ se by looking at the data and data structures that we were looking at . </s>
so , for example , the number of 16@@ 4 is very out of this code ; you can &apos;t over@@ look it . </s>
i started working with scientific literature about how this cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge was built in nat@@ ance and found that they were struc@@ tured in what cas@@ ca@@ des , and every cas@@ ca@@ de , contains 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge . </s>
so that made sense , it fit together . </s>
and it got even better . </s>
these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge in iran are divided into 15 so-called levels . </s>
and guess what we found in the far@@ ri@@ ff@@ y code ? </s>
it &apos;s a almost identical structure . </s>
so again , that fit really well together . </s>
and this gave us a great confidence for what we were looking at here . </s>
now don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t just go that way . </s>
these results have been achieved by a couple of weeks of hard work . </s>
and often we just ran into a s@@ ne@@ ak , and we had to re@@ cover . </s>
anyway , we found that , in fact , both digital war@@ heads are actually on one and the same goal , but in different directions . </s>
the little war@@ head takes over a cas@@ ca@@ de , and it turns over the ro@@ tors and it slo@@ ws them down , and the great jum@@ p@@ pet with six cas@@ ca@@ des in interaction and mani@@ pul@@ ated val@@ ves . </s>
so , in the large and the whole , we &apos;re very confi@@ dent that we actually determin@@ ed what the goal is . </s>
it &apos;s nat@@ ance , and it &apos;s just nat@@ ance . </s>
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals of stu@@ x@@ net could be hit . </s>
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- really made me out of the so@@ cks . </s>
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and on top of it , you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge . </s>
now , what this thing really does is it cat@@ ches the value of the values of sensors -- so , for example , using print sensors and vibra@@ tional sensors -- and it &apos;s providing legiti@@ mi@@ zed code that &apos;s still on the attack , running with false data . </s>
and in fact , this in@@ fer@@ ring data from stu@@ x@@ net has already taken place . </s>
so , it &apos;s just in hollywood movies , where in the pur@@ suit of monit@@ oring the sur@@ vei@@ llan@@ ce camera with previ@@ ous video recor@@ dings . </s>
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ? </s>
now , the idea of this is obviously not just the machin@@ ery of the machin@@ ery in the control of the control room . </s>
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressi@@ ve . </s>
so the idea is to make a digital security system . </s>
we need digital security systems where a human machine oper@@ ator can &apos;t respond fast enough . </s>
so in a power station , for example , if the big ste@@ am tur@@ bine is too quick , you have to open up ex@@ pos@@ ure within milli@@ seconds . </s>
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine . </s>
so in this case , we need digital security systems . </s>
and when they &apos;re en@@ danger@@ ed , then really bad things can happen . </s>
power plant can explo@@ de . </s>
and neither the machine leader , nor the security system , will notice it . </s>
this is frighten@@ ing . </s>
but it gets worse . </s>
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important . </s>
think about it . this attack is gener@@ ic . </s>
he has nothing special to do with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , with ur@@ ani@@ um . </s>
so , for example , he would work exactly as well -- in a power plant or in a car factory . </s>
it &apos;s gener@@ ic . </s>
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attac@@ ker -- you don &apos;t have to put the user data on a us@@ b@@ - stick , as we saw it at stu@@ x@@ net . </s>
you could also use ordinary wor@@ m@@ - technology to dis@@ semin@@ ate . </s>
you have to spread it as far as possible . </s>
and when you do that , you end up getting a cyber@@ weapon of mass destruction . </s>
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to ask ourselves . </s>
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for these attacks is not in the middle east . </s>
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan . </s>
so all these green areas , these are the most powerful environments . </s>
we need to focus on the consequences , and we &apos;re better to prepare for ourselves . </s>
thank you . </s>
i have a question . </s>
r@@ al@@ ph , a lot of it was reported that people think that the mos@@ qui@@ to is the main organization behind it . </s>
is this your opinion to your opinion ? </s>
okay , you really want to know this ? </s>
yeah . okay . </s>
in my opinion , the mo@@ bility is involved , but the driving force is not israel . </s>
so the driving force behind is cy@@ ber super@@ power . </s>
there are only one and those are the united states -- fortunately , fortunately , lu@@ ck@@ ily . </s>
because otherwise , our problem is even bigger . </s>
thank you for hun@@ ting us a fear of fear . thank you r@@ al@@ ph . </s>
i &apos;ve spent the last few years putting myself in situations that are normally very difficult and kind of dangerous at the same time . </s>
i went to jail -- hard . </s>
i worked in a coal mining plant -- dangerous . </s>
i fil@@ med in war areas -- difficult and dangerous . </s>
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing like this -- a little bit difficult in the middle , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end . </s>
actually , i &apos;ve been exposed to the most part of my career for the most terri@@ fying part of my career , and this is just for trying to study social venti@@ l@@ ating things that are comp@@ elling and interesting , and hopefully to understand what makes them fun and accessible to the audience . </s>
so when i knew i would come here , to look at the world of br@@ anding and spon@@ sor@@ ing , i knew i was going to do something a little bit differently . </s>
some of you may have heard that i turned an ad on e@@ bay a couple of weeks ago . </s>
i sent out some facebook news , some twitter news news , and i gave people the opportunity to get the name rights on my tedtalk 2011 . </s>
in fact , some happy people and companies , for@@ -@@ profit and non-@@ profit , the un@@ prece@@ d@@ ented opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let it go again -- to buy the name rights on the talk that you just saw , who you just saw at the time , had neither a title that had a lot of content , and not a lot of clu@@ es about what the issue would be . </s>
so what you got was this : your name here : my tedtalk , which you have no idea what the subject is going to be , and the content ever after the content could ultimately fly around your ears , especially if i would love your company for your participa@@ tion . </s>
but from that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity . </s>
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ? </s>
a whole lot . </s>
this , by the way , is just the oper@@ ator . </s>
so , despite that war@@ ning , i knew that anyone would buy the nam@@ on rights . </s>
now , if you asked me this one year ago , i would not have been able to tell you that with some certainty . </s>
but in the new project that i &apos;m working on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the commer@@ ci@@ als . </s>
as i said , i &apos;ve been in some rather terrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could help me to go to anything so difficult and as dangerous as this guy to the room . </s>
you know , i had the idea for a film . </s>
what i want to do is to make a film about marketing , marketing , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by plac@@ ation , marketing and advertising . </s>
and the film is called &quot; the stran@@ ger ever memor@@ ial . &quot; </s>
so what happens in &quot; the origin of the wait &quot; is that everything from the top to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , is completely ver@@ ched with br@@ ands -- from the cover spon@@ sor you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand x@@ . </s>
now this brand , the qual@@ com@@ m sta@@ di@@ on , the state center ... </s>
these people are being connected to the ever@@ -@@ e@@ ter@@ -@@ e@@ ter@@ nity -- forever -- forever . </s>
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that is what ? in e@@ ter@@ nity , forever ? </s>
i am a red@@ und@@ ant person . </s>
that was more to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze that . </s>
it was &quot; e@@ ter@@ nity , forever . &quot; </s>
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a cover spon@@ sor , but we &apos;ll make sure that we &apos;re going to sell any possible categ@@ ory in the movie . </s>
so maybe we &apos;ll sell a sho@@ e , and he will be the greatest sho@@ e you &apos;ve ever carried ... </s>
the greatest car that they ever dan@@ ced from &quot; the origin of the wait &quot; is the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the origin of the day . &quot; </s>
so , the idea is , besi@@ des being able to show that br@@ ands are part of life , actually , to get them to finance the film ? </s>
and we actually show the whole process of how it works . </s>
the goal of the whole film is transparency . </s>
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of stat@@ s . </s>
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end . </s>
and i &apos;d be happy if ce@@ g was going to help us do this . </s>
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience . </s>
i don &apos;t know how people will be true . </s>
you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use a point of view , because this has a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but you know how this is going to evolve ? </s>
how much money does it take to realize that ? </s>
1.@@ 5 million . </s>
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth trying to address some really known br@@ ands . </s>
who knows when the film comes out , we might see like a hor@@ ror of vol@@ li@@ di@@ ans . </s>
what do you think the answer will be ? </s>
the answer is probably probably going to be &quot; no . &quot; </s>
but is it a difficult thing for the movie of film , or a difficult thing to do ? </s>
j@@ k : both . </s>
so ... so , it means not that optimistic . </s>
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help . </s>
i can help . </s>
okay . </s>
fantastic . </s>
we need to think about which br@@ ands . </s>
yeah . </s>
if you look at the people you have to do with it ... </s>
now , there are some places that we can use . </s>
make the camera out . </s>
i thought , &quot; well , imagine the camera , &quot; would mean that we wanted to make a conversation . </s>
it turned out that it really meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to have a film to do with your film . &quot; </s>
and just as much as these companies disappeared , one after the other . </s>
none of them wanted to do something with the film . </s>
so i was ama@@ zed . </s>
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project . </s>
and i was conf@@ used , because i thought the whole concept of advertising is the idea of pres@@ enting your product as many people as possible , as many people as possible . </s>
especially in the world today , at this inter@@ section of new and old media and the frag@@ mented media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting way of thinking that the mas@@ ses brings that message . </s>
no , that was what i thought . </s>
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fat@@ al mistake , and that was the following . </s>
actually no , that was not the mistake at all . </s>
that would have been no problem at all . </s>
that would have been okay . </s>
but what this image is for is a problem . </s>
if you look at the google search search transparency , this is -- this is one of the first shots of this . </s>
i really like your way , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . now . </s>
that was the problem : transparency -- free of de@@ ception and to@@ wel@@ s , just to discover and look through it , characteri@@ zed by visi@@ bility and access to information , particularly what business means -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem . </s>
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot of transparency now . </s>
our politicians say , our president says it , even our ce@@ os say it . </s>
but when it comes to the point that it &apos;s supposed to be imple@@ mented , something changes . </s>
but why ? well , transparency is an@@ xi@@ ous -- like this curious bear bear , still star@@ ing at me . </s>
it &apos;s un@@ predictable -- it &apos;s like this strange road road . </s>
and it &apos;s also very ris@@ ky . </s>
what else is the risk of ris@@ ky ? </s>
a whole s@@ ale of cool stuff . </s>
that &apos;s very ris@@ ky . </s>
so when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story . </s>
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot; </s>
you see , when i was a kid and my father caught me in the lying -- and there he is , and looking at me with this look -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three ver@@ sions in every story . </s>
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot; </s>
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version . </s>
but there &apos;s only one company , an ag@@ ent@@ ment was willing to help us -- and just because i know john bond and richard kir@@ sh@@ en@@ tree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the middle man and go right to the companies with my team . </s>
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that , when you start talking with these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood is a profound problem . </s>
i have friends who make big , giant hollywood movies , and i have friends who do little calcu@@ lation movies like i do . </s>
and my friends , the big , giant hollywood movies , say that the reason their films is so successful on the br@@ anding partners that they have . </s>
and then my friends , the little s@@ wee@@ ping movies , &quot; well , how are we going to compe@@ te with these big , giant hollywood movies ? &quot; </s>
and the film is called &quot; the tag@@ ging ever . &quot; </s>
so , how exactly will we see a ban ban in the movie ? </s>
whenever i get on my way , and whenever i open the medical cab@@ in@@ et , you will be an im@@ o@@ dor@@ ant . </s>
and every time i interview someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ? </s>
are you there ? they look a little nervous . </s>
i want to help you cal@@ m to cal@@ m down . </s>
so maybe you should put a little bit of this on the interview before the interview . &quot; </s>
and then we offer one of these great dun@@ es . </s>
either &quot; fl@@ ute fusion &quot; or &quot; par@@ ad@@ ise win@@ ds , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice . </s>
we &apos;re going to be equi@@ pped both for men and for women -- solid wheel@@ -@@ on , or stick with a stick , whatever . </s>
this is the short line . </s>
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you a serious note . </s>
we &apos;re a smaller brand . </s>
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we are a brand challen@@ ged . </s>
so , we don &apos;t have a budget as a budget of other br@@ ands . </s>
so doing these things -- you know , re@@ minds people of ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we are interested . </s>
which words would they describe to you in a ban ? </s>
ban is blan@@ k . </s>
that &apos;s a great question . </s>
ob@@ so@@ le@@ te technology . </s>
technology is not the way to describe something that &apos;s going to do under the co@@ ach@@ es . </s>
we talk about bold , fresh . </s>
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this categ@@ ory really does lead to something positive , as opposed to &quot; fi@@ st@@ ability and mo@@ i@@ st@@ ure . &quot; </s>
it keeps you fresh . </s>
how can we keep them fresh longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times fresh . </s>
these sorts of things have a positive effect . </s>
and this is a million con@@ cer@@ ts . </s>
what about me ? what about the dru@@ ping st@@ ones ? </s>
i have to talk to the guy on the road that are like me , ot@@ to normal consu@@ l@@ tan@@ ts . </s>
i want you to tell me something about my brand . </s>
how would you describe your brand ? </s>
h@@ mm@@ m , my brand ? </s>
i don &apos;t know . </s>
i really like beautiful clothes . </s>
&quot; 198@@ 0s re@@ vi@@ val re@@ vi@@ val &quot; except the wash@@ ing day . </s>
all right , what &apos;s the brand ger@@ ry brand ? </s>
unique . </s>
i think the style of the style i have is &quot; dark glamour . &quot; </s>
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gray colors and stuff like this . </s>
but usually i have an ac@@ es@@ so@@ ire , like sun@@ glasses , or a je@@ wel@@ ry and a je@@ wel@@ ry . </s>
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic mer@@ ce@@ des cab@@ rio . </s>
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m going to say , i would say , &quot; du@@ h fly . &quot; </s>
woman 2 : part of hi@@ pp@@ ie , part of yo@@ g@@ i , part of brooklyn girl -- i don &apos;t know . </s>
man 3 : i &apos;m the m@@ old guy . </s>
i sold s@@ wal@@ lows across the country , worldwide . </s>
so , i think that &apos;s my brand . </s>
this is my brand in my little , di@@ stor@@ ted industry . </s>
man 4 : my brand is fe@@ de@@ x because i &apos;ve been outside . </s>
man 5 : to@@ w@@ ning al@@ co@@ hol addi@@ ct . </s>
is that what ? </s>
lawyer : i &apos;m a instruc@@ tor brand . </s>
i &apos;m tom . </s>
well , we can &apos;t all be the tom@@ -@@ brand , but i often see myself at the inter@@ section of dark glamour and practic@@ er fly . </s>
and what was noticed was that i needed a experts . </s>
i needed someone who could go into my head , someone who could really help me understand what they call the &quot; mar@@ ken@@ character . &quot; </s>
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ alt@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ burg . </s>
they have helped fir@@ ms like ne@@ st@@ le , fe@@ sts , hall@@ mark helped to discover that mar@@ row . </s>
if they could do it for them , they could also help me . </s>
they brought their pictures , right ? </s>
that &apos;s what i did . the first picture is a picture of my family . </s>
just tell me a little bit about how this is connected to your thoughts and feelings about yourself . </s>
these are the people that make my world@@ view . </s>
tell me about the world . </s>
m@@ d : the world ? i think the own world is the world that you live in -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so on . </s>
all of these things come from one place , and they come to me and start with my family in west virginia . </s>
which is the next thing you want to talk about . </s>
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life . </s>
what kind of thoughts does that mean to the thought and feelings about yourself ? </s>
it &apos;s the way i want to be . </s>
i like things that are different . </s>
i like things that are que@@ ar . i like que@@ ar things . </s>
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; period -- what does she get us ? </s>
what &apos;s the ma@@ che@@ te ? what pu@@ p@@ pet stage are they at right now ? </s>
why is it important to re@@ boot ? what represents the red ? </s>
tell me a little bit about that part . </s>
a little bit more about them , they &apos;re not . </s>
what other me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ sen have they run through ? </s>
... that doesn &apos;t have to be fear . what kind of roll@@ er@@ co@@ aster are you going to be ? </s>
ee@@ ee@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you . </s>
thank you for your pati@@ ence . </s>
yeah . all right . </s>
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen out of it . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of crazy things going on there . </s>
the first thing that i saw was this idea that her br@@ anding personal person@@ i , two separate pages , has de@@ v@@ ou@@ red pages -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lo@@ ck brand is an ei@@ ght-@@ foot brand . </s>
the de@@ als are very good . </s>
and i think there &apos;s almost a con@@ tradi@@ ction with it . </s>
and i think some companies are just going to focus on one star@@ ch , rather than both . </s>
a lot of companies tend to -- and that is human nature -- to avoid things where they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and they &apos;re wel@@ coming them , and they &apos;re actually turning them into something positive for themselves , and that &apos;s a skill box . </s>
so what other br@@ ands are doing like this ? </s>
the first one is a classic , apple . </s>
and you can also see it here , target , wi@@ i , min@@ i of min@@ i co@@ op@@ er and je@@ t@@ blue . </s>
well , there are br@@ ands and eight feet of br@@ ands , these things that come and go , but one of them was , eight , eight brand is a pretty strong thing . </s>
one ei@@ ght@@ less , inter@@ played brand . how is your brand brand ? </s>
if someone asked them to describe their brand identity , their mark@@ ers , how would it be ? </s>
you &apos;re going to get an up@@ side ? are you something that &apos;s bringing blood in whe@@ els ? </s>
or are they more of a down@@ -@@ the-@@ shel@@ f ? </s>
are you something a bit more quiet , more reser@@ ved , more conserva@@ tive ? </s>
up attribu@@ tes are things that are do@@ om@@ ed , fres@@ h@@ man like the amount of prin@@ ce , ti@@ m@@ ingly , ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , se@@ vent@@ ly , like er@@ ol fl@@ yn@@ n , agi@@ le and agi@@ le , pro@@ spe@@ ct , glori@@ ous , ma@@ gical and my@@ sti@@ cal like gand@@ al@@ f . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
or are they more like a down@@ -@@ the-@@ shel@@ f ? </s>
are they ei@@ ght@@ ful and mon@@ gu@@ n like 00@@ 7 ? </s>
are they establi@@ shed , tradition@@ ally , nur@@ sing , prote@@ ctive , com@@ passionate like op@@ ra@@ h ? </s>
are they reli@@ able , stable , family , safe , born , hol@@ y , re@@ ten@@ tious , and way the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ? </s>
over the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up up and down , and the no said , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project . </s>
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product . </s>
but , in fact , 17 br@@ ands that were willing to take on this control of the control that wanted to do with someone who wanted to deal with someone who wanted to be so ei@@ ght-@@ si@@ gh@@ ted , and eventually em@@ powered us to tell stories that we would not otherwise have never told -- stories that a value never would be suppor@@ ting . </s>
it en@@ ables us to tell the story of neuro@@ marketing , just as we tell the story in this film , that you &apos;re using mri today to p@@ in the pleasure centers of the brain , to make both advertising and movies and movies . </s>
we went to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o , where foreign advertising had been ban@@ ned . </s>
in the entire city , for five years , not an an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary , no poster , no fl@@ yer , no fl@@ yer . </s>
and we went to school distri@@ cts where businesses were moving their way into deva@@ stat@@ ing schools , all over america . </s>
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got most feedback from , or where i &apos;ve had the greatest success , those are where i inter@@ ac@@ ted with things directly . </s>
and that &apos;s what these br@@ ands have done . </s>
because they went around the middle man , and they went around the agen@@ cies , and they said , &quot; the ag@@ ents may not really have their interest in meaning . </s>
i &apos;m going to negoti@@ ate with the artist . </s>
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that makes people think that our world@@ view is challenging . </s>
and how was that for you ? what was it going to be successful ? </s>
well , since the movie of the s@@ und@@ ance film festival pre@@ mi@@ ere , we can look at this . </s>
according to bur@@ r@@ ning , the pre@@ mi@@ ere was the pre@@ mi@@ ere in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 9@@ 00 million calls from this film . </s>
that &apos;s actually just a period of two and a half weeks ago . </s>
this is just online -- no press , no television . </s>
the film was not deli@@ vered yet . </s>
it &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no stre@@ aming . </s>
it &apos;s not yet come out in other countries . </s>
well , the film ended up a very large moment@@ um moment@@ um . </s>
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every advertising agency that we were talking about , has recom@@ men@@ ded their customers , the fingers that we &apos;re talking about . </s>
one of the things that i believe is that when you get your chance , you get risks , you get risks in those risks that you get in these risks . </s>
i think if you stop people from that , you get them closer to failure . </s>
i believe that if you trained your employees to avoid risks , you prepared the whole company to get a profit . </s>
i feel like we need to encourage people to take risks and take risks of risks . </s>
we need to encourage people not to be afraid of possibilities they may be frighten@@ ing . </s>
finally , as we move forward , we should welcome fear . </s>
we should put the bear in the c@@ age . </s>
they &apos;re welcome fear . they &apos;re welcome to risk . </s>
a big spo@@ ff@@ le at each other , so we &apos;re welcome to the risk of risk . </s>
and finally , we should welcome transparency . </s>
no@@ wa@@ days , more than ever before , a bit of honest@@ y takes us very far . </s>
and that said , with honest@@ y and transparency , my whole talk , &quot; they &apos;re welcome transparency , &quot; was given by my good friends of em@@ c , who paid $ 7@@ 100 for the name of e@@ bay at e@@ bay . </s>
big data will turn into big opportunities for organizations around the world . </s>
em@@ c : &quot; they &apos;re welcome transparency &quot; transparency . &quot; </s>
thank you . </s>
now mor@@ gan , on the name of transparency , is : what &apos;s going to happen to the dollar of 7@@ 100 ? </s>
that &apos;s a great question . </s>
i have a check in my pocket , ex@@ pos@@ ure to the top organization of the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ ing foundation -- a check at 10@@ 0-@@ 100 dollars to fund my ted prize in the next year . </s>
my name is am@@ it . </s>
so 18 months ago , i was doing something else at google , and i was trying to do something with muse@@ ums and art , and my che@@ e@@ dy , which is today , gave me green light . </s>
and it took 18 months . </s>
a lot of fun negoti@@ ations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting muse@@ ums from nine countries . </s>
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this . </s>
i think my personal view is very easy to explain with this slide and her access . </s>
i grew up in india . </s>
i became a great training -- i didn &apos;t decide -- but i didn &apos;t have access to a lot of muse@@ ums , and i didn &apos;t have access to this kind of art@@ work . </s>
and when i went traveling and visit these muse@@ ums , i started to learn a lot . </s>
and as i worked for google , i tried this desire to make art accessible -- to bring technology together with technology . </s>
we then formed a team , a great team , and we started with this . </s>
i &apos;m probably going to start with the demonstration and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning of the start . </s>
so , you &apos;re just going to google le@@ proje@@ ct@@ .@@ com@@ . </s>
you can see around these muse@@ ums here . </s>
there &apos;s the u@@ ff@@ i@@ zi , the mom@@ a , the her@@ mit@@ age , the ri@@ j@@ ks , the van go@@ gh . </s>
i actually come to one of my favorite , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york . </s>
you come in for two ways -- very simple . </s>
so , you know , and wh@@ um@@ ms , you &apos;re in this museum . </s>
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference . </s>
you walk around and you am@@ pli@@ fy yourself . </s>
they want to be ori@@ ented at the museum ? </s>
you open up the map , and you jump up with a click . </s>
there they are , they want to go up to the end of the gan@@ gs . </s>
just on . a lot of fun . </s>
sticks them . </s>
thank you , but the best part is still . </s>
so i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite images , harv@@ est workers of pie@@ ter bre@@ u@@ gel in the met . </s>
i see this pl@@ us@@ o@@ und . </s>
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it . </s>
so this is one of the images . </s>
these are all the meta@@ data . </s>
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;m going to click out now . </s>
this is one of the images we &apos;ve held with the so-called gi@@ gap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology technology . </s>
for example , this image has about 10 billion points , i think . </s>
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points ? &quot; </s>
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you now . </s>
you can zoom in very easily and zoom out . </s>
you see a little bit fun here . </s>
i love this guy ; his expression is un@@ affordable . </s>
but then you really want to go deep . </s>
and so i started playing around , and i realized there &apos;s something going on there . </s>
and i thought , &quot; well , wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot; </s>
i went close to ran , and i noticed slowly that these kids actually beat a little bit . </s>
i was resear@@ ching a little bit , talking to some familiar with some known people , and found out that it &apos;s a game called squ@@ a@@ il , which is a gan@@ s at the day of day , with a stick with a stick . </s>
it seems to be quite popular . </s>
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it . </s>
to really close close , you can go to the cra@@ cks . </s>
just to give you a perspective , i zoom out , so you can see what you get . </s>
there we were , and this is the painting . </s>
the best one is still -- in one second . </s>
let &apos;s go quickly to mom@@ a , again in new york . </s>
another favorite picture of me , star night . </s>
in the pre-@@ example , it was about finding details . </s>
but what if you want to see the pink stri@@ p ? </s>
and what if you want to see van go@@ gh doing this master@@ piece of master@@ y ? </s>
you zoom in . you can really go inside . </s>
i &apos;m going to zoom in on one of my favorite pictures of this image , until i really am at the ris@@ es . </s>
that &apos;s star night , probably never seen that before . </s>
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function . </s>
there &apos;s still a lot more , but i don &apos;t have time . </s>
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called colle@@ ctions . </s>
each of you , everyone -- whether rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter . </s>
you can go out and create your own museum online -- for all these images you can put your own collection on it . </s>
very simple , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , and it &apos;s called the power -- you know , you can zoom in . </s>
that &apos;s the don@@ ation , it &apos;s in the national sche@@ du@@ le . </s>
you can see everything with cla@@ ims , sending your friends , and you have a conversation about what you feel when you look at these master@@ pieces . </s>
and i think finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things here don &apos;t come from google . </s>
they don &apos;t even come from the muse@@ ums of muse@@ ums , i think , from the muse@@ ums of muse@@ ums . </s>
i might not want to say that . </s>
they come from artists . </s>
and that was an experience in humili@@ ty for me . </s>
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to talk to this digital medium of art , and they &apos;re or@@ dered properly online . </s>
and that &apos;s the biggest question i asked recently : &quot; did you do that to repli@@ cate the experience of a museum visit ? &quot; </s>
and the answer to that is no . </s>
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience . </s>
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you . </s>
thank you . </s>
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two hal@@ ves . </s>
that &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side . </s>
if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ es of every hemis@@ ph@@ ere , we could chart your brain . </s>
for example , this guy , who is completely logical , is completely logical . </s>
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive . </s>
now , where would you posi@@ tion@@ alize your brain on that scale ? </s>
some of us may have selec@@ ted for one of those extreme , but i think for most people in the audience , the brain looks something like this -- with a high ap@@ ti@@ te , which is at the same time in both hemis@@ ph@@ ere . </s>
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclu@@ sive or anything . </s>
they can be logi@@ cally and intui@@ tively intuitive . </s>
and so i see myself as one of the people , along with most of the other experiment@@ al quantum physi@@ ci@@ sts that need a good amount of logic to add the complex ideas together . </s>
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to actually ex@@ ec@@ ute the experiments . </s>
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love to play with things . </s>
so we go out and we play it and then look how it respon@@ ds , and then we start to develop our intuition there . </s>
they &apos;re basically doing the same thing . </s>
so one of the intui@@ tions that you &apos;ve evolved over the years is probably that one thing at the same time can only be in one place . </s>
i mean , it can also be strange to think that one thing at the same time is two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed it . </s>
i remember watching a child playing on a floor of a soil thres@@ hold . </s>
he was still a child , not very good at it , and he fell all the time . </s>
but i bet it &apos;s a very valuable lesson to play with the floor thres@@ hold , which is that the big things don &apos;t just leave you up , and that you stay in one place . </s>
and that &apos;s a great concep@@ tual model of the world as long as they &apos;re not particle physi@@ ci@@ sts . </s>
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they &apos;re not playing with soil ta@@ ils , but with these little weird particles . </s>
and when they &apos;re playing with their particles , they find all kinds of weird things -- how they fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time . </s>
and so they wrote all these obser@@ vations , and they called the theory of quantum mechan@@ ics . </s>
that was the state of physics a few years ago ; it needed to describe quantum mechan@@ ics to describe the little tiny particles . </s>
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us . </s>
this didn &apos;t sound like my intuition , and maybe because i don &apos;t often play with particles like that . </s>
well , i sometimes play with them sometimes , but not very often . </s>
and i &apos;ve never seen it . </s>
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle . </s>
but my logical side didn &apos;t like it . </s>
because if all things are made of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechan@@ ics , shouldn &apos;t be just the rules of quantum mechan@@ ics ? </s>
i see no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be . </s>
so , i &apos;d better feel a bit better about the whole thing , if we could somehow show the fact that daily objects also follow the rules of quantum mechan@@ ics . </s>
so , i made a couple of years ago , a couple of years ago . </s>
i created one . </s>
this is the first object you can see in the quantum mechanical super@@ position . </s>
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip . </s>
and you can see that green dot there in the middle . </s>
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about right now . </s>
this is a picture of the object . </s>
here i &apos;m going to scale it up . we &apos;re looking at the center here . </s>
and here &apos;s a really large clo@@ se@@ -up of this little piece of metal . </s>
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal , and it &apos;s shaped like a spr@@ int , and it &apos;s over the edge . </s>
so i made this thing in a similar way that you make a computer chip . </s>
i went to a clean room with new sili@@ c@@ um@@ es , and i put it into all the big devices for all the big devices . </s>
for the last few years , i had to build my own machine -- to get this kind of a swimming pool of hole and this thing . </s>
this thing has the ability to be in the quantum mechanical super@@ position , but it takes a little bit of help to do it . </s>
look , let me give you an analog@@ y . </s>
you know how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a full elev@@ ator ? </s>
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elev@@ ator alone , i do all kinds of weird things , but then i add other people , and i listen to all these things because i don &apos;t want to insu@@ lt it , or , frankly , they s@@ mas@@ h . </s>
so , quantum mechan@@ ics says un@@ moving objects are just the same . </s>
the dri@@ vers for dis@@ ability objects are not just people , but the light that seems to them and the wind that fe@@ eds on them and the heat of the room . </s>
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal beha@@ ves quantum mechan@@ ically , we had to throw out all the ma@@ pping . </s>
so that &apos;s what we did . </s>
we turned off the lights , put it in a vac@@ uum and su@@ cked up all the air and cool@@ ed it up until now , all the way in the elev@@ ator , the piece of metal was free to behave like it always wanted . </s>
so we measured his movement . </s>
and what we found was that it &apos;s really strange . </s>
instead of just being there , it vi@@ br@@ ated . the way it was vi@@ br@@ ating was kind of like this -- like a stre@@ t@@ ched and in@@ fl@@ ating bla@@ dder of bla@@ dder . </s>
in which we gave it a little push , we could have it in the same time vi@@ br@@ ating and not vi@@ br@@ ating -- something that &apos;s just in the quantum mechan@@ ics . </s>
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what really fantastic . </s>
what does it mean for an object to vi@@ vi@@ fy and not vi@@ br@@ ating at the same time ? </s>
let &apos;s think about atoms . </s>
so the first case : all the trilli@@ ons of atoms from which the piece of metal are silent , and at the same time , the atoms are moving up and down . </s>
just too precise points of time , they agree with one another . </s>
the rest of the time are del@@ oc@@ ated . </s>
that means that each atom is in two different lo@@ cations at the same time , which means that the entire piece of metal is two different lo@@ cations . </s>
i think that &apos;s really cool . </s>
really . </s>
it was worth it for all this year in the clean room , because , check this out , the mas@@ s@@ able difference between a single atom and this piece of metal is roughly the difference between the piece of metal and you . </s>
so if a single atom can be two different lo@@ cations at the same time , that piece of metal can be two different lo@@ cations , why not you ? </s>
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says . </s>
so , imagine if you were at the same time in a couple of places , what would that feel like ? </s>
how would your awareness deal with your body being lo@@ oc@@ alized in the room ? </s>
there &apos;s another aspect in history . </s>
when we warm it up , sha@@ ping the light and looking in the box , we saw that the piece of metal always was there in a piece . </s>
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elev@@ ator are really just ri@@ cher objects that are built together in a small space . </s>
you hear a lot of talking about how quantum mechan@@ ics says everything is connected to everything . </s>
well , that &apos;s not exactly true . </s>
there &apos;s more of it , it &apos;s still deeper . </s>
it &apos;s so that these connections , your connections with all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechan@@ ics . </s>
thank you . </s>
in the year of 2007 , i decided we should re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we think about economic development . </s>
it should be our goal that if families think about where they live and work , the opportunity is to choose between at least one hand full of different cities that all compe@@ ted in competition to get new resi@@ dents . </s>
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal . </s>
there are billions of people in the developing world who don &apos;t even have a single city that they would welcome to . </s>
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs them to build it . </s>
so we could do the world &apos;s very simple , very simple , perhaps hundreds of new cities . </s>
now this may sound absur@@ d for you , as soon as you &apos;ve never thought about new cities . </s>
but let &apos;s just share the building of a@@ part@@ ments to the cities . </s>
imagine half of the people who want to live in a@@ part@@ ments did this ; the other half still didn &apos;t . </s>
you could try and expand the capacity of existing a@@ part@@ ments already . </s>
but you know what they &apos;re going to say , in these homes , in those homes and their surro@@ und@@ ings , the laws of law to avoid compla@@ ints and to de@@ fle@@ ct from building out . </s>
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to get out of all these exten@@ sions . </s>
but you could go to a completely new place , build a completely new block of block , predi@@ cted the laws there would support such a structure and not prevent it . </s>
so i suggest@@ ed that governments create new areas that provide enough space for a city , and gave them a name : char@@ ter cities . </s>
i found out later that , around the same time , ja@@ four and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o was thought about the challenge of reform in hon@@ dur@@ as in hon@@ dur@@ as . </s>
they knew that every year , about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ans left their land to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same in hon@@ dur@@ as . </s>
so at this point , ja@@ four has said to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; what happens when we take an un@@ can@@ ny surface of our country -- what if we just give them a message -- a part of the american em@@ bas@@ sy , one part of the can@@ adi@@ an bot@@ t@@ len@@ e@@ cks , and when people want to work on the can@@ adi@@ an rules or the united states , you can work there , and can you work on the surface of these messages what they normally need to go to canada or america ? &quot; </s>
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as under a he@@ art@@ beat crisis . </s>
in the next plan@@ k elections , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo lo@@ bo in a re@@ vel@@ ation whose program promis@@ es both more neu@@ tral and sha@@ ping . </s>
he dem@@ anded oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , going to become his stable . </s>
in the mean@@ time , i was prepar@@ ing a talk to a talk at tedglobal . </s>
through improvement , trial and through the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of char@@ ter city to the fundamental elements . </s>
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you don &apos;t have the existing support of existing housing ow@@ ners . </s>
we &apos;re paying new technologies big attention , but for the progress of progress , it requires technology and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that keep us back . </s>
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from gu@@ atem@@ ala oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o sent the link to the tedtalk . </s>
that again , he showed him ja@@ 4 . </s>
they were called me . </s>
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present that to the rest of our country . &quot; </s>
so we met in dec@@ ember in dec@@ ember of a hotel in mi@@ ami . </s>
i &apos;ve tried to make sense of how valuable cities are , how much valuable they are than they are . </s>
and i used this graph to show you how pre@@ cious ro@@ hl@@ and is in a place like new york -- remember that one area in some cases is worth per square meter of thousands of dollars . </s>
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a place when there was a break , so oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot; </s>
so the tedtalk is in very simple form that a char@@ ter city is a place where a very un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited land is the beginning , a fo@@ ol contract that determined the laws that are there , and the ability to choose the possibility of either to live either under those rules or not . </s>
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as , who meant that we need to make this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to get our country forward . </s>
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa , and i was once on the fourth and five to january , to give an talk . </s>
so i gave another talk to facts about this talk that has been related to a graph that tries to explain that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very big city . </s>
this is a picture of the city of den@@ ver , and the sket@@ ch is the new airport that was built in den@@ ver . </s>
this airport alone has a hundred square kilometers in this airport . </s>
so i tried to convince the hon@@ dur@@ ans if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 square kilometers . </s>
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand ac@@ res . </s>
poli@@ te , they &apos;re all appl@@ au@@ ding . </s>
the audience faces were very serious and very sensitive . </s>
the head of congress came onto the stage , and he said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk . </s>
i &apos;ve got it on my laptop . &quot; </s>
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk . </s>
and i &apos;ve come to the nuclear saying that a new city offers new opportunities to people . </s>
there would be the possibility of living in a city that would be in hon@@ dur@@ as instead of hundreds of miles away in the north . </s>
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders with one . </s>
the government leaders in hon@@ dur@@ as were pro@@ ved to help the help of partner@@ ships , they could benefit from their partner@@ ships to help the laws of the laws for this char@@ ter and during the trans@@ lation that everybody can trust that the char@@ ter is really per@@ formed . </s>
and the reali@@ zation of president lo@@ bo was that , in some sense , the amount of com@@ position i &apos;ve been thinking about as a way of getting out of foreign inve@@ stors could come in and build this town for all parties for all parties in hon@@ oring in hon@@ dur@@ es for many years under fear and mi@@ str@@ ust . </s>
we went into an area . </s>
this is a picture of this place . </s>
it su@@ cks a thousand square kilometers . </s>
and shor@@ tly afterwards , on the 19th of january , you &apos;ve voted to congress for a change in constit@@ ution to have an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed set of rules that are consi@@ stent for special development areas . </s>
in a country that just has a strong crisis behind it , in the congress , it was selec@@ ted to a voice of 1@@ 24 to a voice . </s>
all parties , all the invest@@ ments in society , suppor@@ ted this . </s>
so , to become part of the constit@@ ution , it has to be appro@@ ved twice by congress . </s>
on febru@@ ary 17@@ th of febru@@ ary , it was appro@@ ved for the second time with 1@@ 14 to a voice . </s>
immedi@@ ate after this election , between the 21st and the 24@@ th of febru@@ ary , a dele@@ gation of about 30 blocks traveled to the two places in the world that were most interested in getting into the business of the city . </s>
the one place is south korea . </s>
this is a picture of a large , new down@@ town that was built in south korea -- big than the city of the city . </s>
and everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get per@@ mission . </s>
the other place that was very interested in urban@@ ism is sing@@ apo@@ re . </s>
it &apos;s already built two cities in china , and the third is in prepar@@ ation . </s>
so , if you think about it , it &apos;s where we are today . </s>
they already have a building site ; they already mention that space for the second city . </s>
it &apos;s already worked on a legal system that mana@@ gers allow you to participate , and it will also work on an ex@@ ternal legal system . </s>
one country has already offered to provide its su@@ pre@@ me court as a court for the dis@@ pos@@ al of the village &apos;s cour@@ ts@@ hip system . </s>
also , urban designers and ma@@ inten@@ ance workers are very interested . </s>
they actually bring in funding . </s>
one of the things you already know is that there &apos;s been a lot of r@@ ent . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of businesses that would like to look at in america especially at a place with a free trade zone , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there . </s>
around the world , there are 700 million people who admit that they would like to live in a different place . </s>
one million people have left latin america every year and go to the united states . </s>
a lot of them are fathers who are forced to leave their families to su@@ ck their families -- sometimes single mothers who need to make enough money to make food and clothes . </s>
unfortunately , sometimes kids who try to re@@ store their parents who they , in some cases , have not seen more for a decade . </s>
so what &apos;s the idea for an idea of thinking about hon@@ dur@@ as in hon@@ dur@@ as ? </s>
or even sho@@ cking out of these cities , or hundreds of them around the world ? </s>
so what is it for an idea to ins@@ ist that every family has a choice between multiple cities who are in competition to compe@@ te for new resi@@ dents ? </s>
this is an idea worth spreading . </s>
my friends in hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say , thank you ted . </s>
do you know how many decisions they make in a typical day ? </s>
do you know how many decisions they make in a typical week ? </s>
i &apos;ve recently done a survey with over 2,000 american americans , and the average number of decisions that are terri@@ bly american about a typical american one day is 7@@ 0@@ th . </s>
it was recently made a study with ce@@ os with ce@@ os that they saw the ce@@ os for a week . </s>
and these scientists have just docum@@ ented the different the@@ mes that this ce@@ o emplo@@ ys with , and how much time they spent making decisions related to the issues . </s>
and they found that an average ce@@ o emplo@@ yed emplo@@ yed for 13@@ 9 problems in the week . </s>
and , of course , each of these issues was made of many , many smaller decisions . </s>
fif@@ ty percent of their decisions have been hit within nine minutes or less . </s>
only for about 12 percent of their decisions took them an hour or more of their time . </s>
think about your own decisions . </s>
do you know how many dig@@ its in the nine minutes they make in the nine minutes of categ@@ ory ? the one hour of categ@@ ory ? </s>
how good , do you think they are making decisions in it ? </s>
today i want to talk about one of the greatest decisi@@ on-@@ making problems in our modern era , the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem problem . </s>
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions . </s>
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers . </s>
if i ask you a question , if i &apos;m blind , because i &apos;m blind , just if you want to burn some cal@@ ories . </s>
otherwise , if i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem problem ? </s>
thank you . </s>
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very , very exclu@@ sive way of living , and at least it was really exclu@@ sive . </s>
it was a shop called the dra@@ e@@ gers . </s>
this business , it was almost like a san@@ ctu@@ ary savings . </s>
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ d and wr@@ ong@@ ness and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vege@@ tables and more than two dozen different types of water -- and that was at a time when we have actually dr@@ unk water . </s>
i loved going to this business , but at one point i was wondering , well , how come you never buy anything ? </s>
this is the o@@ live oil gang . </s>
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those who have been in boxes that came from a thousand years of o@@ live trees . </s>
so , one day i decided to visit the fi@@ li@@ ters , and i asked the la@@ dder , &quot; does this model work that you really are off@@ ering all of these choices ? &quot; </s>
and he showed up on the bus la@@ sts of tou@@ ri@@ sts who came every day and usually had their cameras done . </s>
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose mar@@ mel@@ ts for our experiment . </s>
this is her mar@@ mel@@ ting . </s>
they had 3@@ 48 different types of br@@ mel@@ ade . </s>
we &apos;ve set up a little pre@@ mis@@ e directly at the ent@@ r@@ ance of the company . </s>
we put six different ta@@ stes of fla@@ vor@@ s or 24 different fla@@ vor@@ s of fla@@ vor@@ s , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first of all , i &apos;m going to try to stand up and try and name mar@@ mel@@ ts ? </s>
there are more people standing when they were 24 , about 60 percent when they were six , about 40 percent . </s>
and then we looked at what was more likely to buy a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade . </s>
now we saw the reverse effect . </s>
by the people who stayed when they were 24 , only three percent of them bought a glass of br@@ us@@ ade . </s>
from the people who stayed when they were six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade . </s>
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade who had six to choice than if they had selec@@ ted 24 to choice . </s>
now , not to decide to buy a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our black@@ ers -- but it turns out that the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem problem is also affec@@ ting us in very consi@@ stent decisions . </s>
we don &apos;t choose to decide even when it comes to our own best interests . </s>
so the theme of the day : financial saving . </s>
i &apos;m now going to describe to you a study that i did with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , who has been through gu@@ e cam@@ en@@ ica , wa@@ i j@@ ang , where we were making decisions about the reti@@ rement of almost a million american americans in the entire united states of about 6@@ 50 plans across the entire united states . </s>
and what we were looking at was whether the number of gu@@ ards that have been possible for a 40@@ 1 plan plan , the 40@@ 1 plan that affec@@ ts the like@@ li@@ hood that it &apos;s saving tomorrow . </s>
and what we found was that in fact , there was a relationship . </s>
so in this case , we &apos;ve had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that people offered anything between two to 5@@ 9 different fund fund . </s>
and what we found was that the more fund that we were offered was that , in fact , the participa@@ tion rate was lower . </s>
now , if you look at the extre@@ mes , the plans for two fund , the plans to go to the se@@ vent@@ h of the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want . </s>
in the plans that offered almost 60 fund , the participa@@ tion rate now fell on about six@@ th of the six@@ th percentage . </s>
now , it turns out , even if you have to join yourself , if there were more opportunities for choice , even then it has negative consequences . </s>
so the people who decided to participate , more often , the more possibilities they have available to them , the more they for@@ got to choose it and to choose fun@@ ds . </s>
the more opportunities they have available to them , the more they put their money into pure money market@@ places . </s>
none of these extreme decisions belon@@ gs to the decisions that somebody would recom@@ mend if their future financial well-being is important . </s>
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three key negative consequences that offer the offer of more and more choices with each other . </s>
they put the decision on -- push them on , even when it comes to their own best interest . </s>
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions . </s>
they &apos;re more likely to decide for things that make them less pleas@@ ant , even if they make it obje@@ ctive better . </s>
and the key reason for this is that we might enjoy this huge shel@@ f full of may@@ on@@ a@@ ise , mu@@ star@@ d , wr@@ ong@@ ine and mar@@ g@@ ins , but we can &apos;t see the compar@@ ison and limit@@ ations and actually have something out of the fantastic offer . </s>
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different kinds of research that they can just apply in their business . </s>
first of all , limited restri@@ ctions . </s>
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today , that less is more . </s>
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; limited . &quot; </s>
they always worry that they &apos;re losing the box . </s>
but in fact , we see it more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to limit , and the un@@ important similar options are going to go away , well , then there &apos;s a increase in sales , there &apos;s going to be the cost of the cost , and there &apos;s a improvement of decisi@@ on-@@ making . </s>
when pro@@ ctor and gam@@ ble re@@ covered the different head of 26 of the species of 26 to 15 , they were experi@@ encing a increase in sales by 10 percent . </s>
when the golden cat corpo@@ ration was rid of her 10 at the worst sold cats , they found that the prof@@ its were at 8@@ 7 percent -- a result of both the increase , the rise of sales and re@@ ducing cost . </s>
you know , the average super@@ ma@@ cr@@ t today gives you 4@@ 5,000 products . </s>
a typical wal@@ mart gives you 100,000 products today . </s>
but the ne@@ west super@@ market , the world &apos;s ne@@ west super@@ market today , is al@@ di , and they only give them 1,@@ 400 products -- sort of a toma@@ to sauce in do@@ ses . </s>
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that came out recently on the market of man@@ aging the best choice of choice was something that david la@@ ibm son has em@@ powered very much , it &apos;s a program that is offered at harvard . </s>
every single harvard employees now is automatically part of a life fund . </s>
those who really want to make a choice will be offered 20 fund fund , not 300 or more fund . </s>
you know , people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to limit it . </s>
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot; </s>
and the first thing i ask the staff question , &quot; tell me how the opportunities of each other is different . </s>
and if your employees can &apos;t keep them apart , their customers can &apos;t . &quot; </s>
now before we started this lunch , i had a conversation with g@@ ary . </s>
and g@@ ary said that he would be willing to provide all of the people in this audience to provide an all-@@ affordable vac@@ ation to the most beautiful road in the world . </s>
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the road . </s>
and i &apos;d like to read them to you . </s>
and i &apos;m going to give you a couple seconds now to read them , and then i ask them to cla@@ p them when they &apos;re willing to take g@@ ary &apos;s service . </s>
okay . everyone who is willing to take g@@ ary &apos;s service . </s>
are they all ? </s>
all right , let me show you a little bit more about it . </s>
they knew it was a trick , right ? </s>
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey . </s>
i think i may have heard more hands . </s>
all right . </s>
in fact , that you see obje@@ ctively , the first time you had more information than the second time , but i would like to guess it &apos;s going to make it more real time for the second times . </s>
because the pictures suff@@ ered for them real re@@ als . </s>
what brings me to the second technology that is helping them deal with the issue of decisi@@ on-@@ making , it &apos;s the con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation . </s>
it &apos;s that people need to understand the difference between opportunities , which is associated with the consequences of the individual possibilities , and that need to be vi@@ vi@@ dly and con@@ cre@@ cted . </s>
why do people spend age 15 to 30 percent more if they &apos;re using an ec@@ ph@@ -@@ card or a credit card than for bar@@ money ? </s>
because it doesn &apos;t mean that we are effective . </s>
and it turns out that if you make it that feels specific , it &apos;s a very good tool so you get people to save more . </s>
so in a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o leader ter@@ ter@@ o , we did a study with people at the time -- employees that all worked for the ring -- and these people were all in a gathering where they &apos;ve signed their participa@@ tion for their reti@@ rement savings plan . </s>
and during that gathering , we &apos;ve just taken this meeting as it used to be , just as it was , we have added a little bit of one . </s>
the little thing that we added was that we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives when they would save money . </s>
in which we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participa@@ tion by 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people willing to save or an increase by four percent of the amount that they were willing to pay for the savings account . </s>
third technology : categ@@ ori@@ zation . </s>
we can make more categ@@ ories better than more choices than more choices . </s>
so , for example , here &apos;s a study we &apos;ve done in a magazine . </s>
it turns out it &apos;s in the thro@@ wa@@ way of super@@ markets up and down in the nor@@ the@@ ast area , and the number between 3@@ 31 different types of maga@@ zin@@ es have all the way up to 6@@ 6@@ 4 journ@@ als . </s>
but you know what ? </s>
if i show you 600 maga@@ zin@@ es and you divide it into 10 categ@@ ories , or i show you 400 journ@@ als , and you split them in 20 categ@@ ories , you think i &apos;ve given you more choice and a better choice than i would have given you the 400 , if i gave you the 600 . </s>
because the categ@@ ories tell me how i can keep them apart . </s>
here are two different s@@ essi@@ ons . </s>
one is called jazz , and the other is called s@@ wing . </s>
if you think that the left show is going to show up , and the ad on the right is jazz , then you cla@@ p into your hands . </s>
okay , there &apos;s a few . </s>
if you think that the person on the left is jazz , and it &apos;s the one on the right side , please cla@@ wing , please cla@@ p . </s>
okay , a few more . </s>
well , it turns out they &apos;re right . </s>
the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ? </s>
this is a highly un@@ useful categ@@ ory sche@@ me . </s>
the categ@@ ories need to tell the selec@@ tor of the selec@@ tor , not the choice of choice . </s>
and this problem often , if you look at the long li@@ sts of all these fund li@@ sts . </s>
who do you actually want to in@@ form ? </s>
my fourth technology : the pre@@ mis@@ e of complexity . </s>
it turns out that in fact , we can deal with more information than we think we need to simpli@@ fy them . </s>
we need to slowly increase complexity slowly . </s>
let me show you one example of what i mean . </s>
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the pur@@ chase of a car . </s>
here &apos;s a german auto@@ maker that gives you the opportunity to self-@@ con@@ qu@@ er your car completely . </s>
you have to make 6@@ 2 different decisions to make your car completely open . </s>
now , these decisions are different from the number of choices that they provide per decision . </s>
car colors , foreign color of the car -- i have 5@@ 6 opportunities . </s>
motors , ge@@ ars -- four opportunities . </s>
so what i do now is i change the sequence in which the decisions appear . </s>
half of the customers are going to go from the many possibilities , 5@@ 6 car colors to the low possibilities , four ge@@ ars . </s>
the other half of the customers go from the low possibilities , four ge@@ ars , to 5@@ 6 car colors , a lot of opportunities . </s>
what am i looking at ? </s>
how interested they are . </s>
if you constantly use the standard choice in decision , it means you &apos;re going to be overwhel@@ med , the most sacred , i &apos;m losing it . </s>
what they find is that the people who go from the many to the low choice of choice , over and over and over again , the standard choice . </s>
we lose them . </s>
go from the little choice to the many , then they stay in the process . </s>
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities . </s>
the only thing that i did is trans@@ forming the sequence into which this information is presented . </s>
when i start with the simple start , i learn how to choose . </s>
even though the ge@@ ars don &apos;t say anything about my pre@@ fer@@ ences in the inter@@ section of the inter@@ ior , it &apos;s still going to prepare me to pick it up . </s>
it also gets me excited about the big product that i put together , and so i &apos;m ready to motiv@@ ate myself to be an interest in this . </s>
so let me sum@@ mar@@ ize . </s>
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that are the problem of decisi@@ on-@@ making mil@@ ls -- restri@@ ctions -- they are going to be the ob@@ so@@ le@@ te alterna@@ tives ; they &apos;re typ@@ ing -- they &apos;re making it real ; we can do better with more categ@@ ories , less opportunities , to prepare complexity . </s>
and every one of those techniques i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the opportunities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people you provide service to . </s>
because i think the key to the best choice is you &apos;re selec@@ tive for choice . </s>
and the more we are selec@@ tively selec@@ tive , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice . </s>
thank you . </s>
hi . i &apos;m kevin allo@@ c@@ ca , tr@@ end@@ s mana@@ gers on youtube . i &apos;m looking at youtube video . </s>
that &apos;s true . </s>
today we want to talk about how videos are becoming , and then finally , why this is important . </s>
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- when i was young , it seemed so infin@@ itely difficult . </s>
but web video en@@ ables that we all , or all our creative activities , become incredibly famous in part of the culture of our world . </s>
any one of you could be famous about the internet until the next satur@@ day . </s>
but on youtube , more than 48 hours of video will be u@@ plo@@ aded every minute . </s>
it &apos;s going to be a tiny percentage of a tiny percentage rate , and it will look at thousands and thousands of times in the cultural moment . </s>
so how does it work ? </s>
three things : ta@@ ste@@ maker , se@@ cular communities and the unexpected . </s>
well , here we go . </s>
oh my god . oh , my god . </s>
oh , my god ! </s>
who@@ a ! </s>
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w ! </s>
last year , mr@@ vas@@ que@@ z gave this video that he fil@@ med in front of his house in the yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park . </s>
it was 23 million times looked at in 2010 . </s>
this graph shows what it looked like when the video was popular for the first summer . </s>
in fact , they didn &apos;t want to make a viral video . </s>
he just wanted to share a rain@@ bow . </s>
because that &apos;s what you do when you call the yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te mountain . </s>
he had u@@ plo@@ aded a lot of natural video . </s>
and this video was actually sent back in january . </s>
so what &apos;s happening here ? </s>
there was j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ a . </s>
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ night ended the t@@ we@@ et who made the video so popular so popular . </s>
because ta@@ ste@@ maker , like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ a , shows us new and interesting things and show a big audience . </s>
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . go@@ ta get down down fri@@ day . forget about the wee@@ k@@ end to the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ k@@ end . fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day down down fri@@ day . she didn &apos;t think we were going to run this conversation without talking about this video , i hope . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
re@@ bec@@ ca bl@@ ac@@ ks &apos;s fri@@ day is one of the most popular videos of the year . </s>
it was looked at almost 200 million times this year . </s>
this is what the chart looked like . </s>
just like &quot; double rain@@ bow , &quot; it seems to be coming out of nothing . </s>
what has happened that day ? </s>
well , it was fri@@ day , that &apos;s true . </s>
if you want to know , these other ti@@ tles are also fri@@ days . </s>
but what about that day , this particular fri@@ day ? </s>
now , to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 did it , a lot of blogs started writing about it . </s>
michael j@@ . nelson j@@ . nelson j@@ . nelson was a first person to make a joke about twitter . </s>
what &apos;s important is that a single person or a group of ta@@ ste@@ makers took a point of view , divided into a large audience with a large audience . </s>
and then this community was formed by people who shared this great insi@@ der , and started talking about it and playing around with it . </s>
now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ de@@ es of fri@@ day on youtube . </s>
already in the first seven days , there was a par@@ o@@ man for every single week . </s>
unlike the one-@@ minute entertainment of the 20th century , the participa@@ tion of the community is our way of becoming part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or making something new out of it . </s>
&quot; n@@ yan cat &quot; is animation and music in end@@ less loop . </s>
that &apos;s it , very simple . </s>
this year it was looked at almost 50 million times . </s>
and if you hold that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-@@ hour version that was looked at four million times . </s>
even cats look at this video . </s>
cats look at cats looking at this video . </s>
what matters is the creativity that &apos;s in the internet culture of the tech and the gee@@ ks . </s>
there were re@@ mix@@ es . </s>
someone made an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned version of it . </s>
and then it became international . </s>
a whole re@@ mi@@ x community shot out of the floor made by a dum@@ b joke that we can all participate in . </s>
today , we &apos;re not just finding pleasure of something , we &apos;re doing . </s>
who could have done this all the way ? </s>
who could have predi@@ cted the &quot; double rain@@ bow &quot; or &quot; n@@ yan cat &quot; or &quot; n@@ yan cat &quot; ? </s>
what wired books can you write in which there is such a sta@@ ir@@ case ? </s>
in a world where each minute of video , two days of video is u@@ plo@@ aded , only unique and unexpected , like the video of video . </s>
i admit , i wasn &apos;t very interested in how a friend said i was going to look at this wonderful video of a guy that prote@@ cts a guy who prote@@ cts it in new york against bi@@ cycles for bi@@ kes . </s>
i got a ticket because i wasn &apos;t going to go to the bike , but often there are dis@@ abilities that don &apos;t always drive you on the bi@@ p . </s>
since this was completely surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey fa@@ stat@@ ed was funny , and his argument are five million times looking at . </s>
this approach is true for everything we do creative . </s>
and that all leads us to a big question ... </s>
what does that mean ? </s>
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h . </s>
what does that mean ? </s>
ta@@ ste@@ maker , creative under@@ graduate communities , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that everyone has access to and determin@@ es the audience popular in a popular way . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- ju@@ stin bie@@ ber -- took his start to youtube . </s>
no one needs to give your ideas green . </s>
and today , we all feel also as ow@@ ner@@ ship of our pop culture . </s>
and these are not the features of the old media , and they &apos;re also barely meeting the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future . </s>
thank you . </s>
how can i talk about the inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness of women over three generations , and how the amazing power of this inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness of a 4@@ 0-@@ year-old girl mani@@ pul@@ ated girl is mani@@ pul@@ ating her little sister , her mother , her mom and her grandmother five days ago in a small boat in the chinese ocean . an inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness that was stuck in life in the life of this little girl and never disappeared -- this little girl who lives in san francisco now , and she &apos;s talking to you today ? </s>
the story is not over . </s>
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together . </s>
i want to tell you some of the pieces of the puzzle . </s>
imagine the first piece : a man who bur@@ ns his life . </s>
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life has been held together by the simple hope of unit and freedom of his home . </s>
think of it as being in the march of the commun@@ ist in sa@@ ig@@ on , as he needs to admit that his life had been a single waste . </s>
the words , as long as his friends , mo@@ unt his . </s>
he pulled back to the silence . </s>
he died , broke through history . </s>
he &apos;s my grandfather . </s>
i never met him personally . </s>
but our lives are so much more than our memories . </s>
my grandmother had never for@@ gotten his life . </s>
i had to make sure that it wasn &apos;t free , and my job was to learn that the story was trying to cr@@ ush us , but we were left . </s>
the next puzzle part shows how a boat ran out in the early morning red gl@@ ory . </s>
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- in an ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , already with two little girls . </s>
for her , life had asked her one task : the ti@@ mel@@ ine of her family and a new life in australia . </s>
it was completely al@@ ig@@ ned that she could fail . </s>
after a four-@@ year-old and film@@ maker sa@@ ga mi@@ tt , a boat silent on the sea , as fishing as fishing . </s>
all the adults were aware of the risks . </s>
the biggest fear they had was pir@@ ates , ra@@ pe and death . </s>
as most adults on the boat , my mother wor@@ e a little po@@ ison bottle . </s>
in a prison@@ er , only my sister and i would have dr@@ unk her and my grandmother , and my grandmother , and my grandmother . </s>
my first memories are from this boat -- the ste@@ ad@@ y tu@@ ck@@ les of the engine , cla@@ pping a single wave of wave on the front of the boat , the vast and empty hori@@ zon . </s>
i don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates that came a lot of times , but the death of the men of the men on our boat would be fo@@ ol@@ ed , or in the case of the engine , who didn &apos;t want to start six hours . </s>
but i remember the lights of the oil platform in the mal@@ ay@@ an coast , and the young man who broke down and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and to the taste of the first apple that gave me one of the men on the platform . </s>
no apple has ever sle@@ pt this way again . </s>
after three months in a refuge@@ e camp , we landed in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne . </s>
and the next piece of puzzle is about four women in three generations together to build a new life . </s>
we let us go to football ray , one of the work@@ ing-@@ class sub@@ ur@@ bs whose population is made out of im@@ migr@@ ant layers . </s>
unlike the ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned middle cu@@ es that existence me completely unknown to me , there were no sophisticated ones in soc@@ sc@@ ray . </s>
the sm@@ ells from the lo@@ wer@@ es came out of the rest of the world . </s>
and the foun@@ da@@ tions of broken english were ex@@ pi@@ red between people who had one thing in common : they started rein@@ venting new things . </s>
my mother worked on far@@ ms , then on a running band in a car factory , six days , double layers . </s>
you &apos;ve kind of been able to find out the time , english and it quali@@ fi@@ cations . </s>
we were poor . </s>
every dollar was divided , and we were given in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do for it . mostly the new stuff , they always came out of secon@@ dar@@ y hand . </s>
two s@@ nap@@ shots for the school , each to cover the holes in the other . </s>
a school uni@@ form to the butt@@ ons , because she had to reach six years . </s>

home where ? </s>
something ste@@ pped up in me . </s>
there was a meeting for recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot; </s>
my mom , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed . </s>
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted every night , but we were telling each other from our day and listening to the movements of our grandmother in the house . </s>
my mother was suffering from the boat with my mother . </s>

she opened up a computer , she then made a cos@@ me@@ tic training , and he opened another business . </s>
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t wor@@ e the change , angry and un@@ flexible , and kind of fan@@ cy , tra@@ pped between two worlds . </s>
lo@@ ans and spon@@ sor@@ s have been looking . </s>
centers have been built . </s>
i lived in parallel worlds . </s>
in one case , i was the classic asi@@ an student who asked the in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y dem@@ ands of himself . </s>
in the other , i was involved in un@@ safe life , the tra@@ gic sc@@ ars of violence , the drug abuse and the insu@@ lation . </s>
but there was so many years about the aid . </s>
and because of that help , i was actually expres@@ sed in my last year of law university as young austr@@ ali@@ an of the year . </s>
and i was taken from a piece of puzzle to the next cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ te , and the ed@@ ges didn &apos;t fit together . </s>
tan le , anony@@ mous hab@@ it of football , was now tan , refuge@@ e and social activ@@ ist , who was invited to lec@@ tures to places that she had never heard of , and in housing , whose existence they had never imagined before . </s>

i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t be able to do that . </s>
she reminded me that i was as old as they were when we had the boat on the boat . </s>
no , no , no . </s>
&quot; do it easy , &quot; she said . &quot; not what you &apos;re not . &quot; </s>

there had to be another piece of puzzle . </s>
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a new an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but something you need to be gr@@ ateful about , perhaps a gift of the boat . </s>
because in the end , there can be so easily on the hori@@ zon of the hori@@ zon , so ligh@@ t@@ weight can mean that the assu@@ mp@@ tions of the environment can be accep@@ ted to the assu@@ mp@@ tions of the environment . </s>
i &apos;ve now gone enough from my comfort range to know that , yes , the world breaks apart , but not the way you fear it . </s>
possibilities that would not have been allowed are expli@@ cit@@ ly encoura@@ ged . </s>
there was a energy , an in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y optimis@@ m , a strange mix@@ ture of humili@@ ty and wa@@ g@@ ness . </s>
so i followed my gut feeling . </s>
i collected a small team of people to me , for which the sho@@ e@@ de , &quot; is not &quot; an in@@ consi@@ stent challenge . &quot; </s>
we didn &apos;t have a cent for a year . </s>
at the end of one day , i was cooking a giant sou@@ p sou@@ p that we shared . </s>
we worked until late the night . </s>
most of our ideas were crazy , but they were a few brilliant things , and we made the break@@ through . </s>
i met the decision to go to the united states . </s>
after just a journey there . </s>
my gut feeling again . </s>
three months later , i was moved , and the ad@@ venture went on . </s>
before i close the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother . </s>
she grew up at a time where con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local mand@@ ar@@ in was the most important person . </s>
life had not changed for centuries . </s>
her father died shor@@ tly after her birth . </s>
her mother moved her alone . </s>
by 17 , she was the second woman in a mand@@ ar@@ in whose mother beat her . </s>
without her man &apos;s support , she worried her for a sen@@ sation by bringing him to trial and gra@@ ce@@ fully in her own case , and a greater sen@@ sation than she won . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
&quot; not , &quot; it turns out to be un@@ true . </s>
i just sho@@ cked in a hotel room in sy@@ dney when she died , a thousand miles away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne . </s>
i looked through the sho@@ wer wall , and i saw them standing on the other side . </s>
i knew she &apos;d come in to say good@@ b@@ ye to you . </s>
my mother was going to call me a couple of minutes . </s>
a few days later , we walked into a budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in football ray and sat around her sar@@ g . </s>
we told her stories , and we en@@ sure that we were still with her . </s>
by mid@@ night , the mon@@ k came and said he had to close the sar@@ g . </s>
my mother asked us to touch her hand . </s>
she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot; </s>
&quot; because you &apos;ve been keeping them this morning , &quot; he said . </s>
&quot; you didn &apos;t let them go . &quot; </s>
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going through the women . </s>
see who we were , and how life shaped us , we can see that the men that might have come in our lives would be us in the ri@@ ots . </s>
the defe@@ at would have been too simple . </s>
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i &apos;m still thinking about the boat . </s>
who would ever wish to have a wish ? </s>
yes , i &apos;m scared of privi@@ le@@ ged , inten@@ tion@@ ally , inten@@ tion@@ ally . </s>
can i give you a bug in your life , the bra@@ ve every wave of wave , the un@@ bi@@ ased , ste@@ ad@@ y tu@@ ck@@ les of the engine , the vast hori@@ zon that doesn &apos;t guaran@@ tee anything ? </s>
i don &apos;t know . </s>
but if i could give this and i could make it safe , i would do it . </s>
mor@@ e@@ over , t@@ ans is here today in the fourth or five row . </s>
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you . </s>
is it photography at all ? </s>
because this is , of course , a picture you can &apos;t take with his camera . </s>
anyway , my interest in photography began when i got my first digital camera camera at the age of 15 . </s>
and i combined it with my earlier taste of drawing , but it was a little different , because using the camera , the camera was actually in planning . </s>
and when you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you squ@@ ee@@ ze on the trig@@ ger . </s>
so for me , the photography of photography seemed to be more about to be at the right place at the right time . </s>
i believed everybody could do this . </s>
so i wanted to create something else , something that the process begins when the trig@@ ger is expres@@ sed . </s>
pictures like this one : a building site along a road road along the road . </s>
but it has an unexpected turn . </s>
and yet , a reali@@ stic level . </s>
or pictures like this -- dark and color@@ ful at the same time , but everyone with the common goal to keep a reali@@ stic plane . </s>
when i say reality , i mean photography reality . </s>
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you really can get , but i always want to let it look like you could have , in a picture , in a photograph . </s>
photographs where you have to think a short moment in order to find out the trick . </s>
so it &apos;s more about cat@@ ching an idea , as a moment , as a moment . </s>
but what is the trick that makes it reali@@ stic look reali@@ stic ? </s>
is it about the details or the colors ? </s>
is it about the light ? </s>
what makes the illusion ? </s>
sometimes the perspective is the illusion . </s>
but ultimately , it &apos;s how we interpre@@ t the world , and how it can be made on a two-@@ dimensional surface . </s>
it &apos;s not what is reali@@ stic , but what we think is reali@@ stic . </s>
so , i think the bas@@ ics are very simple . </s>
i see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put it together to create an alternative reality . </s>
and let me show you a simple example . </s>
we have three perfectly imagin@@ able physical objects that we can all identify with in a three-dimensional world . </s>
but in a certain way , you can put together something that still looks like three times as if it could exist . </s>
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible . </s>
so we &apos;re head@@ ing our brains because our brain doesn &apos;t really make sense that it doesn &apos;t really make sense . </s>
and i see the same process using pictures of photos . </s>
it &apos;s really just about combin@@ ing different reali@@ ties . </s>
so , the things that make a reali@@ stic look , i think , are the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our daily lives . </s>
but when we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about that , because otherwise they just kind of look wrong . </s>
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow to make a reali@@ stic result . </s>
as you can see , these are not three special pictures . </s>
but you can put something together , but you can make something special here like this . </s>
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective . </s>
secondly , combined photos should have the same lighting species . </s>
and these two pictures ed@@ it these two dem@@ ands -- shot at the same al@@ titude and the same lighting species . </s>
third , it &apos;s not to make it impossible to tell where the individual images start and end by connecting them se@@ am@@ less@@ ly . </s>
it makes it impossible to say how the photograph actually got together . </s>
so by compar@@ ing paint and contrast and bri@@ ght@@ ness to the ed@@ ges of individual images , photogra@@ phic men , like field depth , un@@ seen colors and disorders , we &apos;re going to see the boundaries between the different images and let them look like a single photograph , although a picture basically can con@@ tain hundreds of levels . </s>
here &apos;s another example . </s>
you might think that this is just a landscape that has been mani@@ pul@@ ated , and the bottom of the bottom is mani@@ pul@@ ated . </s>
but this picture is actually completely connected , from photos of different places . </s>
i personally find that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to take a com@@ promise with the ideas in your head . </s>
but it requires a lot of planning . </s>
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle . </s>
for example , the fish was taken on a ligh@@ t@@ weight trip . </s>
the bank comes from another place . </s>
the underwater part comes from a quar@@ ry . </s>
and yeah , i even co@@ ach@@ ed the house on the island on red to make it look sul@@ fur . </s>
so , to achieve a reali@@ stic outcome , it &apos;s going to come from me in terms of planning . </s>
i always start with a sket@@ ch , an idea . </s>
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images . </s>
and here , every piece is very well plan@@ ned . </s>
and when you make good shots , the result can be pretty beautiful , and it can also be quite reali@@ stic . </s>
so they &apos;re all the tools , and the only thing that &apos;s li@@ mi@@ zed us is our imagination . </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects are missing . </s>
and i think the most important thing about this is that we &apos;ve stopped talking with our patients . </s>
and one of the things we introduced to bike b@@ ou@@ d university was to make a major listen@@ er . </s>
it &apos;s not that scienti@@ fically scienti@@ fically -- she makes a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patient , families , rela@@ tives , &quot; how do you do ? </s>
how can we help you ? &quot; </s>
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everyone -- maybe just most of the electronic health projects , because we stopped listening . </s>
this is my wireless age . it &apos;s a very simple thing . </s>
she &apos;s got a button . she &apos;s got a button . </s>
and every morning i jum@@ ped . </s>
and yeah , i &apos;ve got one task , you might recognize . </s>
i put my job at 95 kil@@ os . </s>
it works very simple : every time i jum@@ ped on the or@@ phan@@ age , it sent my data to google health . </s>
and there they are also called down from my univers@@ alist , so he can see where my weight problem is , not just at the moment that i need car@@ di@@ ological support or something , but also with a gli@@ mp@@ se into the past . </s>
but there &apos;s something else . </s>
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 more who on twitter . </s>
so every morning , i &apos;m going to go to my wireless age age , and people are talking to me before i &apos;m in the car , &quot; the lunch is just a little bit of a sal@@ ad , &quot; for lunch . &quot; </s>
but this is the ne@@ west thing that can happen , because this is the group of group pressure , group forced to help patients , because that could be used for obesity , or it might be used by the r@@ ough patients . </s>
but it could also be used to get people out of their cha@@ irs , and get them to play some kind of game together to better control their health . </s>
the next week , this is where it comes to the market . </s>
it &apos;s going to give this little blood pressure device that you &apos;re putting into an iphone or something like that . </s>
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home to send it to their physi@@ cian and share it with others for something more than 100 dollars . </s>
so at this point , patients get into play . they can &apos;t only take control of control , cap@@ tain cap@@ tain on their own ship , but we can help us in health care with the challenges that are ahead of us and the cost explosion of health care , double demand , and so on . </s>
do the techniques that are easy to use , and start embra@@ cing patients in the team . </s>
and they can do that through these sorts of technologies , but also through crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing . </s>
and one of the things that we did , i &apos;d like to share with you through a short video . </s>
we have all the navi@@ gation systems in our cars . </s>
maybe even in our cell phones . </s>
we know exactly where all the at@@ ms around ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht are around . </s>
we know one more thing where all the gas stations are . </s>
and sure enough , we can find fast food cha@@ ins . </s>
but where would the next a@@ ed to help this patient ? </s>
we were asking around , and no one knew it . </s>
no one knew where the next life-@@ saving a@@ ed was in that moment . </s>
so what did we do ? we did crow@@ d@@ source crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing in the ne@@ ther@@ lands . </s>
we built a website , and we asked a crowd , &quot; when you see an a@@ ed , please join us where he is , &quot; when he does , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed during business time , of course . </s>
and over 10,000 dollars have been reported in the ne@@ ther@@ lands . </s>
the next step was to find the apps for this . </s>
and we &apos;ve created an i@@ pa@@ d-@@ app . </s>
we &apos;ve developed an app for la@@ y@@ ar , exp@@ anded reality to find these ae@@ ds . </s>
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht and someone breaks down , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks your micro@@ gram cell phone , you can find the next a@@ ed that can save life . </s>
and what we want today to do today is not just as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u , how the product is called , but also as a@@ ed@@ ly as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us . </s>
and we want to bring this to a worldwide level . </s>
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universi@@ ties , to help us behave like k@@ not@@ ing points to crow@@ d@@ source these ae@@ ds around the world . </s>
and when you &apos;re in vac@@ ation and somebody collap@@ ses , whether it &apos;s your own family , or somebody else , you can find an a@@ ed . </s>
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies around the world are helping us in con@@ fir@@ mation of these ae@@ ds . </s>
these could be cow services , or techni@@ cians , for example , just to make sure that the previous a@@ ed is still at its place . </s>
please help us and try to improve health care , not only to improve the health , but to put it in your hand . </s>
thank you . </s>
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries . </s>
i work in the solar technology industry . </s>
and my little star@@ tu@@ p wants us to force us to protect the environment by ... </s>
-- it &apos;s paying attention to crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing . </s>
here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing . </s>
oh . just a moment . </s>
it may take you until it &apos;s lo@@ aded . </s>
now -- we can just ski@@ p that -- i &apos;m just going to ski@@ p the video instead . </s>
no . </s>
that &apos;s not ... </s>
okay . </s>
solar technology is ... </s>
oh , my time has gone over here ? </s>
okay . thanks so much . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s> . </s>
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design , take a year of time and work in an environment that &apos;s pretty much everything they hate , which they actually hate to work in the government . </s>
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like the peace zone for computer fre@@ aks . </s>
we choose some fel@@ lows every year , and we let them work with urban management . </s>
instead of sending them into the third world , we &apos;re sending them into ra@@ th@@ ars . </s>
and they developed great apps , worked with urban workers . </s>
but what they really do is to show what &apos;s possible today with technology . </s>
so they meet al . </s>
al is a hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston . </s>
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really is looking for is someone who st@@ ops him when he &apos;s limited , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fir@@ st-@@ bat@@ t@@ ling when he was covered by a meter of snow . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
how did he get to look for this particular kind of aid ? </s>
we had a team last year a team of fel@@ lows in boston the code for america for america . </s>
they were there in febru@@ ary , and there &apos;s been a lot of work in the last febru@@ ary . </s>
and they realized that the city would never open up the hy@@ dr@@ ant . </s>
but one particular fellow , a man named er@@ ik michael el@@ s-@@ ob@@ er , noticed another thing , and that was that the resi@@ dents fre@@ ak up the side@@ walks , right in front of these parts . </s>
so he did what any good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an app . </s>
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adop@@ t a hy@@ dr@@ ant . </s>
you agreed to s@@ ne@@ ak up when it ra@@ ins . </s>
if you do that , you can give it a name , and he called the first al . </s>
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it off . </s>
so , there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic . </s>
this is a hum@@ ble little app . </s>
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 apps that the fel@@ lows have written in the last year . </s>
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other government technology . </s>
it &apos;s expanding rapidly . </s>
there &apos;s this guy in the i.@@ t. di@@ vision of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adop@@ t the citizens of tsunami si@@ r@@ ines . </s>
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami si@@ des work , but people ste@@ al the batter@@ ies . </s>
so he got the citizens to check her . </s>
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean the clo@@ s@@ est of apo@@ logi@@ zing . </s>
and chicago has just introduced them so that people would open up the bu@@ ll@@ sh@@ it when it ra@@ ins . </s>
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app . </s>
and it has ri@@ gged , of course , organic , of course . </s>
if you know something about government technology , you know that it &apos;s usually not going to go . </s>
so the software of software takes a few years to do this . </s>
we had a team that worked on a project last year in boston for three people two and a half months . </s>
it was a way of trying to find out what the right public schools are for their children . </s>
we were later told that if it took over the normal chan@@ nels , it took over two years , and it costs over two million dollars . </s>
and this is not something yet . </s>
there &apos;s a project right now in the california right now that the tax@@ pa@@ yer costs for two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work . </s>
and there are projects like this at every level of government . </s>
so an app written in a couple of days , and then stre@@ t@@ ched out of sel@@ fis@@ hn@@ ess , is a kind of shot in front of the front of the boat in the government institutions . </s>
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private company , how many people think she should . </s>
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself . </s>
and that means free access , which means open and productive . </s>
and that &apos;s important . </s>
but what &apos;s more important about this app is that it represents a new generation , including the problem of government -- not as the problem of a sales institution , but as a problem of collective trade . </s>
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we are very good at collective action with digital technology . </s>
now there &apos;s a great community of people who make the tools that we need to put things together in the effectively . </s>
it &apos;s not just code for america &apos;s fel@@ lows , there are hundreds of people around the country who are standing up and writing government apps every day in their own communities . </s>
they didn &apos;t give up the government . </s>
they &apos;re terri@@ bly fru@@ strated with her , but they don &apos;t compla@@ in about it , they fix it . </s>
and these people know something that we lost from the eyes . </s>
and that &apos;s when you all forget your feelings about politics and the sna@@ ke of work and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , government , in the core , in the words of tim o &apos;@@ rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot; </s>
today , a lot of people have given the government . </s>
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i want you to think that you &apos;re thinking about this because things are changing . </s>
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change . </s>
and because the government eventually took their power out of us -- remember , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- as we think about it will affect how this change happens . </s>
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program . </s>
and like a lot of people , i thought that the government of the government is mostly about choo@@ sing people into an office . </s>
now , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s mostly local to mar@@ ry in terms of th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ines . </s>
this is the call center for service and information . </s>
that &apos;s where you typically come out in your city , 3@@ 11 . </s>
if you ever have the chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott sil@@ ver@@ man as part of the program -- in fact , you all do that -- you &apos;ll see that the people who are calling government for a lot of different problems , including a mar@@ su@@ pi@@ al rat in your house . </s>
so scott , she gets this proce@@ d@@ ure . </s>
he &apos;s ti@@ cking &quot; mar@@ g@@ ins &quot; into the official datab@@ ase . </s>
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he cat@@ ches with the animal species . </s>
and finally he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the live@@ stock &apos;s skin ? &quot; </s>
and that worked . appl@@ ause for scott . </s>
but that was not the end of the th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine . </s>
it didn &apos;t just have a call center . </s>
it has an app , a web and hand app , called &quot; citi@@ zen . &quot; </s>
we didn &apos;t write the app . </s>
this is the work very bright people at the office of the new urban mechan@@ ics in boston . </s>
one day -- this is an actual report -- it came in : &quot; mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized in my trash , &quot; can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead . </s>
how do i get them removed ? &quot; </s>
but what happens to the citizens of citizens is different . </s>
scott was talking to human beings . </s>
but on &quot; citizens , &quot; everything is public , so everyone can see it . </s>
and in this case , it saw a neighbor . </s>
and the next ent@@ ry that we received was , &quot; i went over there , i found the trash behind the house . </s>
mar@@ g@@ ins ? yes . alive ? y@@ ap . </s>
it turned out to the site . went home . </s>
good night , cute mar@@ g@@ ins . &quot; </s>
pretty simple . </s>
that &apos;s great . this is the digital true of the physical . </s>
and it &apos;s also a good example of how government is in crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing . </s>
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform . </s>
and i &apos;m not going to talk about a technical definition of the platform here . </s>
i &apos;m talking more about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others . </s>
a citi@@ zen helped another citi@@ zen , but the government played a central role here . </s>
so she connected these two people . </s>
and you would have allowed them to connect them with government services if they had needed , but a neighbor is a much better and cheaper alternative to state services . </s>
when one neighbor is helping the other , we streng@@ then our communities . </s>
if we call the animal species , it costs a lot of money . </s>
one of the most important things is that we need to think that government is not the same as politics . </s>
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other . </s>
that our contribu@@ tion to the system is to vote . </s>
how many times we &apos;ve selec@@ ted a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we sat back , and we expect that the government of our values and our needs to our needs , and then not so much has changed . </s>
it &apos;s because government is like a far@@ ther ocean , and politics is the top eight inches . </s>
and what &apos;s below is what we call bure@@ au@@ cra@@ cy . </s>
and we use that word with such con@@ temp@@ t . </s>
but it &apos;s this con@@ temp@@ t that we own , that we pay for , what we &apos;re paying for , something that works against us , something different , and then we made ourselves ourselves . </s>
people seem to think , politics is sexy . </s>
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bure@@ au@@ cra@@ cy sexy . </s>
because that &apos;s where the real government work is happening . </s>
we need to go to the government of government . </s>
so the occu@@ pa@@ tional movement movement has done it . </s>
did you see these guys ? </s>
it &apos;s a group of concerned people who wrote a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report , who is an answer to the se@@ c of the se@@ c membran@@ e of financial reform . </s>
this is not poli@@ tically active , that &apos;s the bure@@ au@@ cra@@ tic activity . </s>
well , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children . </s>
you have to imagine the huge challenges that you have to ask . </s>
do we really believe that we can achieve what we need to do without improve an institution that in the name of all of us can act ? </s>
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to become more efficient . </s>
the good news is that technology makes it possible to fundamentally shift the function of government in a way that can actually achieve something by empower@@ ing society . </s>
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not as hard to do things together , you have to build all right systems . </s>
now the average age of our fel@@ lows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you . </s>
this is a generation that grew up to see their voice for granted . </s>
they &apos;re not fighting this fight that we &apos;re all strug@@ gling to talk about , who is to speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to talk . </s>
you can make your opinion , every channel at every channel , and you can do it . </s>
so when you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices as well . </s>
they &apos;re using their hands . </s>
they use their hands to write applications that improve the government of government . </s>
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities . </s>
this could be , open up a hy@@ dr@@ ant , to h@@ unt un@@ cr@@ us@@ hed , to turn a ho@@ b@@ ble with a th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine . </s>
and sure enough , we would have the those hy@@ dr@@ ant that can open up all the time , and a lot of people would . </s>
but these apps are like tiny digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we are not only consumers of government who are recei@@ ving ta@@ xes and achie@@ vement . </s>
we are more than that , we are citizens . </s>
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve citi@@ zen@@ ship . </s>
so the question that i have all of you here : if it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all together , will we be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands as well ? </s>
thank you . </s>
normally my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming up are going to be , and i thought , since i &apos;m here with friends here , i would tell you what i really think , and also try to look back and understand what &apos;s really going on here , with these incredible jum@@ ps going forward , which is so ra@@ pid that we can barely keep up with them . </s>
i &apos;m going to start showing you a little bit about a boring slide . </s>
... could you just show the slide for a second . </s>
this is a slide i &apos;m random@@ ly selec@@ ted from my fol@@ der . </s>
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but it &apos;s actually the kind of gener@@ ic form . </s>
this slide shows a analysis of the performance of ris@@ ky process@@ ors compared to the performance of a local area . </s>
what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like some of the people that we often meet in our field , are a kind of a se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ arith@@ mic curve . </s>
in other words , every step here correspon@@ ds to a poten@@ cy in the performance scale . </s>
and this is a no@@ vel@@ ty that we need to use this guy scale to se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ arith@@ mic cur@@ ves in the field of technology . </s>
something very strange is happening here . </s>
so this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here . </s>
so , if you could , please , take the lights back up . </s>
another h@@ unter , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper right now . </s>
now , why do we draw gra@@ pher@@ s in technology on se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ arith@@ mic cur@@ ves ? </s>
the reason for this is , if i draw it onto a normal curve , where , say , this is the years , so the ti@@ mel@@ ine of a species , and this is a random mass of the technology that i want to represent with a graph , then the graph becomes sil@@ ly . </s>
they look like this . </s>
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much . </s>
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transportation technology , then that would be very un@@ rational in the se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ arith@@ mic scale , in form of a flat line . </s>
but if something like this happens here , this changes the qual@@ it@@ ative conditions . </s>
so if the transportation technology was pro@@ gr@@ essing as fast as the micro@@ process@@ or technology , we could go into a tax@@ i over@@ morning , and in 30 seconds we would be in to@@ k@@ yo . </s>
but it &apos;s not that fast . </s>
this has never been seen before in the history of technology , this kind of rec@@ ur@@ sive growth , where the mag@@ ni@@ tude of the mag@@ ni@@ tude is going exponenti@@ ally . </s>
so the question i want to ask you now is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , you &apos;ll see , they &apos;re not going to go on forever . </s>
it &apos;s not possible that everything evol@@ ves forever and forever as fast as we go on . </s>
so , there are two choices . </s>
either it &apos;s going to be a classic s-@@ classic curve like this , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here . </s>
so that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . </s>
now , i &apos;m an opti@@ mist , so i think something like this is going to happen in the way that it &apos;s going to happen . </s>
it &apos;s true , that means we &apos;re right here in the middle of a transition . </s>
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the bis@@ in world to a new kind of world . </s>
so the question that i want to ask myself , and also a lot of myself , is how this new world is going to be like ? </s>
what is this new condition that the world is starting to take ? </s>
because the transition seems to be very , very conf@@ using when you &apos;re in the middle of it . </s>
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in the year 2000 , and people were often talking about what was going to happen in the year 2000 . </s>
now here &apos;s a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in the year 2000 . </s>
more than that , we &apos;re not going to go . </s>
so in other words , the future has shr@@ unk every year by a year since i &apos;ve been in this world . </s>
i think the reason for that is that we realize that anything is in gan@@ gs . </s>
the transition is happening . we can feel it all . </s>
and we know that right now , it doesn &apos;t make sense to try to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything will be so different that a simple high calcu@@ lation of what we &apos;re making now simply doesn &apos;t make sense . </s>
so i want to talk about what that might be , this transition that we &apos;re in right now . </s>
in order to do that i &apos;m first going to talk about some other things , which really don &apos;t have anything to do with technology or computers . </s>
because i think in order to really understand this , we need to take a step back and look at this on a longer time scale . </s>
and that &apos;s what i want to look at on the time scale of the earth &apos;s life . </s>
i think the big picture makes sense when you divide it into some billi@@ on-@@ dollar steps . </s>
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.@@ 5 billion years , and the earth was a big , mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ined stone cl@@ um@@ p with a lot of the chemicals in it . </s>
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , then that gives us a pretty good picture of how they did it . </s>
i also believe there are theor@@ ies that start to understand how everything with r@@ na started , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simpli@@ stic story which is that at this time , little oil dro@@ ple@@ ts were wea@@ ving around , which held different kinds of reci@@ pes for chemicals . </s>
some of these oil dro@@ ple@@ ts had a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integra@@ te other chemicals from outside and to grow . </s>
they were all like this , and they started to divide . </s>
these little oil dro@@ ple@@ ts , in the sense , were the most primitive cell form . </s>
but these oil dro@@ ple@@ ts were not about alive in the modern sense , because every single one of them was just a small , random reci@@ pe of chemicals . </s>
and every time it divided , it has spread out of that chemicals to un@@ equal quanti@@ ties . </s>
so every dro@@ ple@@ t was a little different . </s>
in fact , the dro@@ ps , which had one for the growth of an opti@@ mal com@@ position , had more faster than others , and more and more chemicals from outside , and they shared faster . </s>
so that ten@@ ds to survive longer , and they multi@@ p@@ ly in a lot of the way . </s>
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but it &apos;s interesting when these dro@@ ps learned a trick about abstra@@ ction . </s>
in any ways we don &apos;t quite understand , these dro@@ ps have learned the ability to de@@ code information . </s>
they &apos;ve learned to store the reci@@ pe of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical form that we call dna . </s>
in other words , in this memory , evolutionary way , they found a way that allowed them to re@@ write , what they stood out of , so that that information could be stor@@ ed and cop@@ ied . </s>
what &apos;s amazing about this is that this kind of information stor@@ age over the age of 2.@@ 5 billion years , which has happened in the same way . </s>
in fact , the reci@@ pe is the reci@@ pe for us , which is our genes from exactly the same code and the same writing . </s>
and every being in life is using the exact same letters and the same code . </s>
we are so far that we can only write for the quality of the code that we do in this code . </s>
and i have 100 micro@@ gra@@ des here of a white pul@@ se , which i try to keep in air@@ por@@ ts away from security leaders . </s>
so in this case -- what i did is i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use to symboli@@ ze -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna , and i made it 10 ^ 22 times . </s>
so if somebody wants a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i &apos;ve got enough for anyone in this room and even for anyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here . </s>
if i had actually been a sel@@ fish , then i &apos;d written it onto a virus and put it into the room . </s>
so what &apos;s the next step ? </s>
the re@@ writing of dna was an interesting step . </s>
and this en@@ ables these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years . </s>
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that &apos;s where these cells started to communicate and exchange information so that communities evolved from cells . </s>
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange your dna . </s>
and that &apos;s why , for example , the consi@@ sten@@ cy of antibio@@ tics is growing . </s>
some bacteria have figured out how to keep up with pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and have this information written with other bacteria in dna , and now we have lots of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , because the bacteria communicate each other . </s>
this communication now allowed the reasons of communities , which in some sense were in the same boat ; they were sy@@ ner@@ ge@@ tic . </s>
so they either survi@@ ved together , or they went under , which meant that when a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly re@@ lie@@ ved and pre@@ fer@@ red by evolution . </s>
so the trans@@ it spot is now where these communities come so close so close that they decided to write the reci@@ pe for the whole community into a drawing chain on dna . </s>
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years to go . </s>
at this point , we have multi-@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of many shift cell@@ ular designs that make together together as an organism . </s>
in fact , we &apos;re also such a multi-@@ cell@@ ular community . </s>
we have a lot of cells who are no longer on their own . </s>
your skin cells are us@@ eless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on . </s>
so these communities started developing so that the level that evolution was happening no longer was the single cell , but the whole cell community that we call organism . </s>
the next step was now within these communities . </s>
the cell communities began to abstract information again . </s>
and they developed special structures that did nothing else than to process information within the organism . </s>
and these are the neural structures . </s>
so the neurons are the information processing of information that these cell community communities have built . </s>
they started educ@@ ating speci@@ alists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding the information of information . </s>
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities . </s>
this gave them an evolutionary advantage . </s>
because at this point an individual -- learning has happened within the time of the lifes@@ pan of a single organism , rather than this evolutionary time . </s>
so one organism could learn to eat a certain fruit because she ta@@ sted bad@@ ly and made it sick the last time he e@@ aten it . </s>
now this could now happen within the lifetime of an individual organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information had to be learned by the individuals who died because of this fruit , because that information processing structure had not yet been there . </s>
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process using these particular information structures because evolution could now take place within an individual . </s>
it could take place within a ti@@ mel@@ ine learning . </s>
what happens after that is that individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other . </s>
for example , as an example , the most subtle version of this communication version of this communication is human language . </s>
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it . </s>
i have a very complicated , un@@ fol@@ ded , un@@ fol@@ ded idea in my head . </s>
i &apos;m sitting here , and there &apos;s basically some basic sounds of notes that i hope to create in the sense of creating a similar idea in your head that has a kind of simil@@ ari@@ ties with my original idea . </s>
so we take something very complicated , it turns it into sound , a sequence of sounds , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others . </s>
so this allows us to work again as a uni@@ fied organism . </s>
and what we &apos;ve actually done , we have humanity , is we started abstract . </s>
we go through the same stages that made multi-@@ cell@@ ular organisms -- the abstra@@ ction of our methods of how we capture data , pres@@ enting , process , process . </s>
so , the invention of language , for example , was a little bit like this . </s>
tele@@ ony , computers , video con@@ ve@@ ys , c@@ d ro@@ ms , and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we built in our community to have this information . </s>
and it conne@@ cts us all together to something that is much bigger , and it &apos;s also able to continue more rapidly than we have been . </s>
so today , evolution can happen in the time of micro@@ seconds . </s>
you &apos;ve also seen t@@ ys this little evolutionary example of where he showed a bit of evolution in the con@@ vol@@ ence program , right in front of your eyes . </s>
so now we fa@@ st-@@ forward the ti@@ mel@@ ine . </s>
the first steps of the story that i told you about is a billion years per piece . </s>
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , per@@ formed a few hundred million years . </s>
then the next steps , like language and so on , turned less than a million years . </s>
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be very few decades . </s>
the process fe@@ eds itself and becomes so , i think , car cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word -- if anything is rein@@ forced to change its change . </s>
the more it changes , the faster it changes . </s>
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of explosion . </s>
we see the process that &apos;s feeding itself . </s>
i live on building computers from computers , and i know that i could use the mechanism that i use to build computers without the recent advan@@ ces in computing in computer technology . </s>
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design those in the traditional sense . </s>
i don &apos;t know what every single transi@@ stor does in the wir@@ ing machine . </s>
it has billions of them . </s>
what i do instead , which is also the designers of thinking machines , is , we think , in a certain abstract level , we think about this machine , and the machine is doing something that goes far beyond our ability , better and faster than we could ever do . </s>
and she does it par@@ tly in terms of ways that we don &apos;t even understand . </s>
a method which is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using a lot of time , is evolution itself . </s>
and we &apos;re inst@@ all@@ ing an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going down in the micro@@ second area . </s>
in order to give an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed from random in@@ struc@@ tions . </s>
we say , &quot; computers , there &apos;s a hundred million random@@ ly selec@@ ted sequ@@ ences of instruc@@ tions . </s>
now , please do all these random in@@ struc@@ tive instruc@@ tions , lead to all the programs , and eventually choose the ones that mine pre@@ ten@@ ds to be . &quot; </s>
so in other words , i define what i want first . </s>
let &apos;s say i want to make numbers of numbers , which would be a simple example i &apos;ve been using it for . </s>
so find programs which are most likely to form numbers . </s>
now , of course , the chance of random in@@ struc@@ tive instruc@@ tions is that they &apos;re very small in chance to make numbers of numbers , so i guess they &apos;re not going to be the instruc@@ tions of the instruc@@ tions . </s>
but one of those might be two numbers of numbers back in the right order of order . </s>
now i say , &quot; computers , you &apos;re going to take the 10 percent of the sequ@@ ences that my pres@@ ent@@ ations have come from . </s>
put that off , dele@@ te the rest . </s>
now , all the rest of the rest of the people who are best worried about the numbers . </s>
and it &apos;s with a method of re@@ combin@@ ation , analo@@ g to re@@ production . &quot; </s>
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the children sc@@ are the features of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es of the two programs . </s>
so i have a new generation of programs that emerged through combin@@ ations of programs that have come in a little bit closer than others . </s>
say , &quot; please repe@@ at this process . &quot; </s>
ac@@ com@@ mo@@ date it . </s>
lead maybe some mu@@ tations . </s>
and try this again with another generation . </s>
all of these generations takes a few milli@@ seconds a few milli@@ seconds . </s>
and so i can run an evolution over millions of years into computers within a few minutes , or in more complex cases , a few hours . </s>
and finally , i &apos;ve got programs that can make the numbers perfect . </s>
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write by hand . </s>
and when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work . </s>
i tried to understand them . </s>
it &apos;s ob@@ sc@@ ure and strange programs . </s>
but they do the job . </s>
i know , and i &apos;m sure you get the job done , because you get out of a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that have done the job . </s>
because their lives depen@@ ded on whether they were doing the job right . </s>
i sat at a 7@@ 47 with mar@@ vin min@@ sky , and he came up with a map and says , &quot; oh look . check this out . </s>
it says , &quot; this airplane is made up of hundreds of thousands of pieces that work together to make your flight sa@@ fer . &apos; don &apos;t you feel more reli@@ able ? &quot; </s>
we know that a process of development is not opti@@ mal when it becomes too complicated . </s>
so , we &apos;re starting to rely on computers , for a process which is very different from the classi@@ cal engineering process . </s>
it allows us to produce things like a much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow us to produce . </s>
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities of that yet . </s>
so , in a sense , the technology is tran@@ scen@@ dent us . </s>
now , we use these programs to make the computer a much quick@@ er much more quickly , so that we can do this processes even faster . </s>
so , it &apos;s a re@@ cu@@ per@@ ation . </s>
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so puzz@@ ling . </s>
because all these new technologies from today are being fed by themselves . </s>
we pick up . </s>
we &apos;re at a point where analo@@ g is at the time when cell organisms have evolved to multi-@@ cell@@ ular organisms . </s>
so we &apos;re the am@@ bs , and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell are we actually going to create here . </s>
we &apos;re in the middle of that starting point . </s>
but i really believe that after us , something else is coming . </s>
and i find it very high from us to say that we are the end product of evolution . </s>
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of whatever the next thing is . </s>
well , the lunch is before , and i &apos;m thinking i &apos;m listening to you now before i get selec@@ ted . </s>
my story begins right here in ra@@ jas@@ than , about two years ago . </s>
i was under the star sky in the desert with su@@ fi sing@@ er mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar ali . </s>
we talked about it that nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian e@@ po@@ s &quot; ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot; </s>
when we wanted to travel at the time , we jum@@ ped into a car and s@@ wir@@ l across the sky . </s>
now we &apos;re doing this with air@@ planes . </s>
at the time , when the great indian war@@ ri@@ or prin@@ ce had ar@@ jun@@ a , he took an ar@@ c , la@@ p into the floor and water ste@@ pped up . </s>
now we &apos;re going to do that with dri@@ ll@@ s and machines . </s>
we came up with the conclusion that magic and magic have been re@@ placed by machines . </s>
that made me really sad . </s>
i got a little bit of a fear of technology . </s>
it made me worry that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sun without a camera , without t@@ we@@ et to my friends . </s>
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill . </s>
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little sil@@ ver wal@@ let . </s>
this piece of 50 year-old technology became the most ma@@ gical thing for me . </s>
she became a golden access to a world full of pir@@ ates and en@@ danger@@ ed ships and images in my imagination . </s>
i thought it was as though our send clo@@ cks and cameras were going to dream about it . </s>
they thought they were inspired by this . </s>
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use them to make magic rather than killing . </s>
when i was 16 , i began to illu@@ strate books . </s>
when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a device for story@@ telling that rea@@ ders can connect rea@@ ders all over the world . </s>
it can know how we hold it . </s>
it can know where we are . </s>
they bring images and text together , and animation , sound and touch and touch . </s>
the story@@ telling takes more and more senses . </s>
but what do we do with this ? </s>
i &apos;m just going to k@@ ho@@ ya , an interactive i@@ pad app . </s>
it says , &quot; put your finger on any light . &quot; </s>
and so -- here &apos;s the box , &quot; this box is -- &quot; i write my name . </s>
and i &apos;m going to show you a character in the book . </s>
and over and over again , a letter goes down for me -- and the i@@ pad knows through gps where i live -- it &apos;s actually add@@ ressed to me . </s>
the child in me is really excited about these sorts of things . </s>
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic . </s>
i mean , i don &apos;t mean magi@@ cians and dra@@ gon , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all have as children . </s>
fire@@ flies in a glass found always quite exciting . </s>
so here you have to get the i@@ pad ki@@ pping out the fire@@ flies . </s>
and the ill@@ um@@ es the way through the rest of the book . </s>
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single mar@@ ve . </s>
and so here , every book , and every world , is going to be a little bit of a mar@@ ker that i &apos;m getting here to the ma@@ gical device in the device . </s>
and this opens up a map . </s>
fan@@ t@@ asy books have always maps , but these cards were static . </s>
this map grows and is lighting and ser@@ ving for ori@@ entation in the rest of the book . </s>
it also turns out to be other places in the book . </s>
i &apos;m going in here . </s>
it &apos;s important for me to make something that in@@ dis@@ mal is also very ti@@ me-@@ consum@@ ing . </s>
these are the ap@@ sar@@ as . </s>
we &apos;ve all heard of fe@@ es and ny@@ mp@@ sions , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the ap@@ sar@@ as ? </s>
the poor ap@@ sar@@ as were caught thousands of years in indian in@@ dr@@ as in an old bra@@ ve book . </s>
and we bring them back in a contemporary history for children . </s>
a story that has been diver@@ ged with new issues , like the environmental crisis . </s>
the issue of environmental crisis , a big problem for the last 10 years , is that children are sitting in their rooms , their computers , without getting out . </s>
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology . </s>
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to search . you have to go out and collect the camera of the i@@ pa@@ ds images of natural objects . </s>
as a child , i had colle@@ ctions of sticks , st@@ ones , ti@@ ps and sh@@ ells . </s>
in a way , the children don &apos;t do that anymore . </s>
the childhood ritual is being brought back . you have to go out to make a picture of a flower and tag a photograph of a flower . </s>
in another chapter , you need to photogra@@ phic a piece of building and tag and tag . </s>
this is actually how you create a digital collection of photos that you can put online . </s>
a child in london shows the picture of a fu@@ ck , and he says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fu@@ dge today . &quot; </s>
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot; </s>
and this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you &apos;ve actually taken . </s>
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities for connecting the world and technology to connect together . </s>
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you &apos;re using the video of the i@@ pa@@ ds video , and through aug@@ mented reality , it &apos;s an animation that looks like a plant in front of a plant in front of the house . </s>
at a point , the screen fil@@ ls with leaves . </s>
you have to make the sound of the win@@ ds , blow them away and read the rest of the book . </s>
we all move towards a world where the forces of technology are getting closer and closer to the magic and technology . </s>
we use the energy of the sun . </s>
we bring our children and closer to the natural world and on the magic , fun and love and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story . </s>
thank you . </s>
so this is really an extraordinary honor for me . </s>
i spend most of my time in investi@@ g@@ ating people , pris@@ ons , or death cells . </s>
i spend most of my time with the social we@@ ak@@ est in social sett@@ le@@ ments and places where there &apos;s a lot of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness . </s>
being here at ted , watching and hearing how stimul@@ ating that is , has given me a lot of force . </s>
in the short time here , i realized , ted has an identity . </s>
you can say things that have influence in the world . </s>
and sometimes when something comes about ted , it becomes a meaning and force that otherwise would not have . </s>
i say that because i think identity is very important . </s>
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations . </s>
and i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher matters meaning , but that the words of a committed teaching is especially meaningful . </s>
as a doctor , you can do good . as a physi@@ cian , you can do more . </s>
and that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity . </s>
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer . </s>
i learned this from my grandmother . </s>
i became big in a family , a traditional african american house@@ hold house@@ hold , domin@@ ated by a matri@@ ar@@ ch , and this matri@@ ar@@ ch was my grandmother . </s>
she was a ta@@ sty , strong woman , she had effect . </s>
she had the last word in every family argument . </s>
she was also the origin of a lot of den@@ ti@@ ties in our family . </s>
she was a sla@@ ve family &apos;s daughter . </s>
their parents were born in virginia as sla@@ ves in the 18@@ 4@@ 0s . </s>
it was born around 18@@ 80 , and the experience of sla@@ very shaped their world@@ view very strong . </s>
my grandmother was strong , but she was also lo@@ ving . </s>
when i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and hu@@ gged me . </s>
she pus@@ hed me so hard that i could barely breathe . then she let me go . </s>
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; br@@ yan , do you feel my hu@@ g ? &quot; </s>
and when i said no , she hu@@ gged me again . when i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;d leave me in quiet . </s>
it was something that made you want to be close to your head . </s>
the only problem was she had 10 children . </s>
my mother was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 children . </s>
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention . </s>
my cous@@ ins walked around all the way around . </s>
i remember , i must have been eight or nine , that i wo@@ ke up one morning and went into the living room . all my cous@@ ins walked around . </s>
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room , and he star@@ ed at me . </s>
first of all , i thought that was a game . </s>
i looked at her and i s@@ mil@@ ed , but she looked very serious . </s>
it went so 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up and came over to me . she took me on my hand , and she said , &quot; come , br@@ yan . you and i , we need to talk . &quot; </s>
i remember it as if it was yesterday . </s>
i &apos;ll never forget it . </s>
she took me out , and said , &quot; br@@ yan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you &apos;re not going to pass it . &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; promis@@ ed , grand@@ ma . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; honest@@ y ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; </s>
she sat down , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve seen you . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot; </s>
i will never forget that . </s>
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to give me three things , br@@ yan . &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; okay , grand@@ ma . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; first of all , i promis@@ ed you will always love your mom . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; your mom &apos;s my baby , and you &apos;ve got to promise you &apos;re always going to take care of them . &quot; </s>
so i promise my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , grand@@ ma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot; </s>
and then she said , &quot; well , what i &apos;m going to do next is that you &apos;re going to do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot; </s>
i thought , &quot; yeah , grand@@ ma . i promise you . &quot; </s>
and finally she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise to me is &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink al@@ co@@ hol . &quot; </s>
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grand@@ ma . i promise you . &quot; </s>
i grew up on the land , on the old , rural south , and i have a brother who is a year older and one year younger sister . </s>
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and he brought this six-@@ pack beer with my sister and me and i went to the forest . </s>
we just fl@@ our@@ ished there as well as otherwise . </s>
then he took a drink of beer , and he took my sister in one of my sister , and she took them , and then she offered me one . </s>

my brother said , &quot; well , we do . today we do that , but we &apos;ll do everything we do . </s>
i had what , your sister had something . go on , drink a beer . &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . just make it . just make it . &quot; </s>
my brother star@@ ed at me . </s>
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? now , drink what . &quot; </s>
and he looked at me and he said , &quot; oh no , you know , you &apos;re not going to be crazy because of the conversation with grandmother . &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot; </s>
he said , &quot; grand@@ ma tells everybody that they are special . &quot; </s>
i was deva@@ st@@ ated . </s>
i &apos;m going to give you something . </s>
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that . </s>
this is perhaps going to be broad@@ ca@@ sting . </s>
i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m standing that i &apos;ve never dr@@ unk a drop of al@@ co@@ hol . </s>
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s virtu@@ ous . i say that because identity is power . </s>
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us that they don &apos;t really believe in first . </s>
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not . </s>
of course , my grandmother would tell all their grand@@ children , they were something special . </s>
my grandfather was in the prison of a pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion in jail . </s>
my un@@ cle died in al@@ co@@ hol indu@@ ced diseases . </s>
and she believed that these are the the@@ mes that we need to take care of . </s>
i tried to say something about our justice system . </s>
this country is different than 40 years ago . </s>
in 197@@ 2 , 30@@ 0,000 people were in domesti@@ c attacks and in jail . </s>
today , it &apos;s 2.@@ 3 million . </s>
the united states today has the highest in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rate in the world . </s>
seven million people are dis@@ char@@ ged with pre@@ currency or with un@@ condi@@ tional pun@@ ish@@ ment . </s>
in my opinion , mass in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies have changed our world . </s>
in social gu@@ ards and black parts of the population , des@@ pair and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , because of that changes . </s>
one out of three male black , between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , in jail , in prison , or with un@@ condi@@ tional pun@@ ish@@ ment . </s>
in urban communities everywhere in the country -- from los angeles , across phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of black young men are either in j@@ ar , in prison , in prison , to in@@ fer@@ ior , or with condi@@ tional pun@@ ish@@ ment . </s>
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have ra@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness , it &apos;s also de@@ pos@@ iting poverty . </s>
we have a justice system in this country that they treat much better when they &apos;re rich and guil@@ ty than poor and inno@@ cent . </s>
asse@@ ts , not debt , influence the outcome . </s>
and yet , we seem to be very happy with this . </s>
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems . </s>
we lost the connection . </s>
i find that interesting . </s>
so , there are some highly interesting things . </s>
my hom@@ eland of al@@ ab@@ ama &apos;s al@@ ab@@ ming them continu@@ ously when they &apos;re con@@ vi@@ cted , when they &apos;re con@@ vi@@ cted . </s>
here and now in al@@ ab@@ ama , 34 percent of the male black people have constantly lost their vot@@ es right . </s>
we predi@@ cted that 10 years from now , the rate of con@@ fir@@ mation of ci@@ vic ambi@@ tion is as high as the com@@ pen@@ sation of the election . </s>
the silence is ear anes@@ thes@@ ia . </s>
i &apos;m repres@@ enting children . </s>
a lot of my clients are very young . </s>
the united states of america is the only country in the world who con@@ vi@@ cted three-@@ 10@@ -year-old children to death in jail . </s>
in this country , for children &apos;s lon@@ ger-@@ term house@@ hold sent@@ ences , there &apos;s no de@@ fault pun@@ ish@@ ment . </s>
we &apos;ve done a lot of proce@@ dur@@ es . </s>
the only country in the world . </s>
i &apos;m repres@@ enting people in death cells . </s>
the issue of death pen@@ alty is an interesting question . </s>
we believe , because you have taught us that the real question is : has a human being deser@@ ved to die for one of his cri@@ mes ? </s>
that &apos;s a very sensitive question . </s>
but you can also think about it , depending on how we see our identity . </s>
the other view is not : anybody deser@@ ves death for a crime , but did we deser@@ ve to kill it ? </s>
i find that fascinating . </s>
the death pen@@ alty in america defined by error . </s>
on nine people we &apos;ve execu@@ ted , one that we &apos;ve discovered for inno@@ cence , which is un@@ guil@@ ty , has been du@@ mp@@ ed out of the death cell . </s>
an amazing failure rate . one from nine inno@@ cent . </s>
i find that fascinating . </s>
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane , if for nine planes that pick up , one dro@@ w@@ ning . </s>
but somehow , we can get ourselves off of this problem of this problem . </s>
it &apos;s not our problem . </s>
it &apos;s not our bur@@ den . </s>
it &apos;s not our fight . </s>
i talk a lot about these questions . </s>
i &apos;m talking about ra@@ ces , and the question is whether we &apos;re going to kill the right thing . </s>
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m teaching my students african american story . i &apos;m talking about sla@@ very . </s>
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time at the end of the re@@ construction , all the way through the beginning of the second world war ii . </s>
we don &apos;t really know very much about it . </s>
but for the afri@@ can@@ -@@ american in this country , it was a time of terror . </s>
in a lot of places , people had to be afraid of ly@@ n@@ ch@@ mo@@ bs . </s>
or before bom@@ bs . </s>
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life . </s>
these older people now come up to me and say , &quot; m@@ r , ste@@ ven@@ son , you talk , you &apos;re holding talks . you &apos;re telling people to stop saying that , for the first time , we have to do it in the history of our nation with terrorism , after 9 / 11 . &quot; </s>
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with this . &quot; </s>
and after terrorism , of course , the race ren@@ der@@ ing and decades of the rapidly motiv@@ ated sub@@ mission and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d . </s>
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems . </s>
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history . </s>
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our actions have in the historical context . </s>
we &apos;re constantly hit@@ ting each other . </s>
we &apos;re always creating new ten@@ sions and conflict . </s>
it &apos;s hard to tell you to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ation . </s>
in south africa , people understood that the race of race is not to overcome , without the will@@ ing@@ ness to truth and recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ation . </s>
even after the geno@@ cide in rwanda , there was this will@@ ing@@ ness , but not in this country . </s>
i &apos;ve given a few talks about the death pen@@ alty in germany . </s>
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply distur@@ bing to hear you talk like this . &quot; </s>
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death pen@@ alty . </s>
and of course , it can never give you more . &quot; </s>
it became very quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible for us to ever go back to syste@@ matic kill killing people . &quot; </s>
it would be da@@ un@@ ting of us , consciously , and conf@@ used people . &quot; </s>
i thought about it . </s>
how it would feel to live in a world where german state left people , especially if they were un@@ propor@@ tion@@ ally many je@@ ws . </s>
it would be in@@ toler@@ able . </s>
it would be pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly . </s>
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we set people up -- here &apos;s the risk of being con@@ vi@@ cted to death , 11 times higher if the vic@@ tim knows , as if it &apos;s black , it &apos;s 22 times higher , and the vic@@ tim knows it -- in the same state -- in the same state where the body is ro@@ wing the body . </s>
and yet , there is this mental log@@ ging . </s>
i think our identity is threat@@ ened by our identity . </s>
if we don &apos;t deal with that , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are also affected . </s>
we love innovation . </s>
we love technology and creativity . </s>
we love entertainment . </s>
but eventually , these reali@@ ties become con@@ vi@@ cted of suffering , abuse , abuse , al@@ ig@@ n@@ ment . </s>
it seems to me that both of them seem to be connected . </s>
because what we &apos;re talking about is that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to be able to pass into a complex world . </s>
for me , time means to bring up and talk about the poor , the dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ged , those who never will be at ted . </s>
but thinking in a way that is integrated into our own lives . </s>
we all have to believe in the end of the things that we can &apos;t see . </s>
we do . so , we &apos;re rational , so we estimate intelle@@ ct . </s>
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming from our heads . </s>
they come from ideas that are driven by con@@ vi@@ ction in our hearts . </s>
it &apos;s this head@@ -@@ heart connection that i believe is driving us , not just to be open to all the bright and inspiring things , but also for the dark and the proble@@ matic . </s>
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the great c@@ ze@@ cent politi@@ cian , once said , has said . </s>
&quot; when we f@@ ought in eastern europe , we wanted to do everything . but what we needed most is hope , a intellectual ori@@ entation , the will@@ ing@@ ness to be even hop@@ eless places and witness to be witness . &quot; </s>
this mental ori@@ entation is the core of what i think need to be involved in as well as the ted community . </s>
there is no distin@@ ction for technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , border and in@@ justice . </s>
i want to war@@ n you . this kind of identity requires a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t care about it . </s>
she &apos;s going to touch her deeply . </s>
as a young lawyer , i hat@@ ed the great privilege of meeting pink parks . </s>
and again parks parks came back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ y , where she tra@@ ded two of her oldest friends , john never car@@ r , who organized the mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ y bus boy@@ k@@ ot@@ t -- an incredible afri@@ can@@ -@@ american -- and virginia dur@@ r , a white man , cli@@ ff@@ ord dur@@ r , dr. king particip@@ at . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
so these women were meeting and they were just sta@@ ying . </s>
and occasi@@ onally , woman car@@ r called me and said , &quot; br@@ yan , woman park comes into the city . we want to stop . </s>
would you like to get there and listen ? &quot; </s>
and i said , &quot; yeah , i love . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot; </s>
and i went over and i was just listening . </s>
it was always so inspiring , so thri@@ ll@@ ing . </s>
one day i was sitting there watching these women , and after a couple of hours , wife parks turned to me to tell us , &quot; well , br@@ yan , tell me what the initiative is for the same . </s>
what try to achieve them ? &quot; </s>
i started my usual talk . </s>
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to get to ine@@ justice . &quot; </s>
w@@ r wants to help people who have been con@@ vi@@ cted inno@@ cent . </s>
we want to fight bias and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the crimin@@ al justice system . </s>
we want to elimin@@ ate life sent@@ ences without in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies without de@@ com@@ posing children . </s>
we want to do something about the death pen@@ alty . </s>
we want to reduce the number of chie@@ fs . </s>
we want to elimin@@ ate mass in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies . &quot; </s>
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; hu@@ h . m@@ hmm . mm@@ hmm . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; it will make you very , very tired . &quot; </s>
then , m@@ r car@@ r up to me , put a finger on my face , and he said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you must be very , very ta@@ sty . &quot; </s>
and that &apos;s why i believe the ted community should be more po@@ tter@@ y . </s>
we need to find ways to make these challenges : these problems , that kind of suffering . </s>
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity . </s>
in my work , i learned very simple things . </s>
i learned a couple of very simple things . </s>
that we are all more than the worst we &apos;ve ever done . </s>
i think that &apos;s true of every human being on the planet . </s>
when someone &apos;s lying , he &apos;s not just a li@@ ar . </s>
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong to him , he &apos;s not just a th@@ b . </s>
even who kill@@ s somebody is not just a mur@@ derer . </s>
and because that is , there &apos;s a basic human dignity that has to respect the law . </s>
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth . </s>
i don &apos;t think so . </s>
i think that in too many places the opposite of poverty is justice . </s>
and finally , i believe that although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so gra@@ ti@@ fying , we &apos;re not being measured at the end of our technology , not the things that we &apos;re developing , not based on our intelle@@ ct . </s>
ultimately , a society will not be measured by how they treated their rich and powerful and privi@@ le@@ ged , but how to deal with the poor , the jud@@ gment , the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated . </s>
because in that context , we first begin to understand the truly amazing things that make us up . </s>
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story for the end . </s>
sometimes i push too much . </s>
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all . </s>
sometimes these ideas are ahead of our thinking , in a very important way . </s>
i &apos;m repres@@ enting these kids who have been con@@ vi@@ cted too hard pun@@ ish@@ ment . </s>
i go to the gro@@ cer@@ y store , and i visit a cli@@ ent who may be 13 or 14 or 14 or 14 or 14 or 14 years old . </s>
and then i wonder : how could that happen ? </s>
how can a judge turn someone into something that he doesn &apos;t ? </s>
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child . </s>
one night , i stayed up too long and thought , oh my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have magic forces . </s>
right , br@@ yan , the judge has magic forces . </s>
you should want your wi@@ sh@@ es . </s>
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think more , i started working on a phone . </s>
i had a 14 year-old , poor black young boys as a cli@@ ent . </s>
and i started with this post . the head@@ line was : &quot; yi@@ eld , my arms , 14@@ -year-old ja@@ el@@ ds like a privi@@ le@@ ged white , white , 7@@ 5@@ -year-old se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-old . &quot; </s>
in my announ@@ cement , i explained that the mis@@ behavior of the state of the state and the police and the fla@@ vor@@ s of aff@@ air@@ s are to take care of . </s>
there was a crazy line about that , in this country , there &apos;s nothing more important that there &apos;s just no mis@@ behavior . </s>
the next morning i wo@@ ke up and i didn &apos;t know if i had just dre@@ amed of this crazy tre@@ a@@ ties , or i &apos;d actually written it . </s>
and to my inten@@ tion , i had not just written it , but i sent it to the court . </s>
a few months went on , and i had just for@@ gotten everything . </s>
finally , i decided , oh my god , i have to go into the cour@@ ts and this crazy case . </s>
i got into the car , and i was really overwhel@@ med -- overwhel@@ med . </s>
so i went to the court . </s>
and i thought , it &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful . </s>
finally , i went out of my car , and i walked up the stairs . </s>
when i was up to the court , there was an el@@ derly , black man , the jan@@ it@@ ors in the court . </s>
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; </s>
he came up to me and hu@@ gged me . </s>
then he whis@@ per@@ ed me into the ear . </s>
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of her . &quot; </s>
and i have to say , it gave me power . </s>
it touched something deeply deep in me , identity , the ability of every single one to contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope . </s>
well , i walked into the cour@@ ty@@ ard . </s>
as soon as the judge saw me . </s>
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you put this crazy arri@@ val ? &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started to discuss . </s>
and more and more people came in , just because they were angry . </s>
that i had written these crazy things . </s>
police offic@@ ers came in and de@@ pu@@ ted state forests and office workers . </s>
it was a cour@@ thou@@ se with people who were angry with people who were angry , that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about ine@@ quality . </s>
from my sight , i saw the jan@@ it@@ ors going up and down . </s>
he saw over the window over and over again , and he could hear the whole to@@ hu@@ w@@ an@@ h@@ u . </s>
he went up and down . </s>
finally , this older black man came in with a very concerned facial expres@@ sed face in the cour@@ ty@@ ard , and he sat right behind me , almost to the defense bank . </s>
ten minutes later , the judge qu@@ it a break . </s>
during the break , a police offic@@ er was coming in , bo@@ ther@@ ed that the jan@@ it@@ ors was in the cour@@ ty@@ ard . </s>
this de@@ pu@@ ty ran over to the older black . </s>
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what do you do in the cour@@ ty@@ ard ? &quot; </s>
the older black man stood up . he looked at the de@@ pu@@ ty , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come in to tell this young man , you don &apos;t lose the goal out of the eyes . don &apos;t give up . &quot; </s>
i came to the ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral com@@ mu@@ te of the universe is far out , but that it &apos;s a ri@@ ft of justice . </s>
that as humans , we &apos;re not completely developed , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and basic values . </s>
that our daily survival is connected to the survival of each individual . </s>
that we need to connect our visi@@ ons of technology and creation , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice and justice . </s>
and most of all , i want to just tell those of you who see this as well , just say , don &apos;t lose the goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give up . </s>
you &apos;ve seen an obvious wish in this audience , and you &apos;ve heard about helping them and to do something . </s>
what else can we do ? </s>
br@@ yan ste@@ ven@@ son : well , there are opportunities everywhere . </s>
if you live in california , there &apos;s a national decision in this spring where it &apos;s actually an effort to do something about the flow of money that &apos;s otherwise flo@@ wing into the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment . </s>
so , in california , for example , in the next five years , you &apos;re going to give a billion dollars for the death pen@@ alty for the next five years . a billion dollars . </s>
and yet 4@@ 6 percent of all don@@ ors don &apos;t end up with ar@@ rest . </s>
5@@ 6 percent of ra@@ pe cases don &apos;t come from trial . </s>
there &apos;s a chance to do something . </s>
this talk is going to pro@@ pose that money is going to invest in security and to invest in security . </s>
i think there are opportunities everywhere . </s>
over the last three decades , the offen@@ sive rate in america has dec@@ lined immen@@ se rate . </s>
and that &apos;s a reality that &apos;s often going into a cor@@ relation with the increase in in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation numbers . </s>
what would you say to someone who belie@@ ves this ? </s>
now , in fact , the number of violent crime didn &apos;t change very much . </s>
most of the mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ations in this country didn &apos;t really find it in the class of violent crime . </s>
it was the mis@@ placed cr@@ us@@ ade for drugs . </s>
so , the dramatic high numbers come in the prison prison@@ ers . </s>
we let ourselves te@@ ar down from the rhe@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ ment . </s>
now we have &quot; tri@@ -@@ sh@@ it &quot; laws that get people behind , for a bicycle the@@ ft , for the the@@ ft of a good good good , rather than that you forces them to give back to the sacrifi@@ ce of the sacrifi@@ ce of sacrifi@@ ce . </s>
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a offen@@ se , not less . </s>
and i think our current pun@@ ish@@ ment of aff@@ air@@ s is not helping anybody . </s>
i think that &apos;s what we need to change . </s>
br@@ yan , you really did have a string on the edge of this . </s>
they are an inspi@@ rational personality . </s>

oh my god . </s>
so these are just some of the cli@@ ps i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but they could have been the last six days , or the last six years . </s>
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative subjects because our minds are paying attention to these issues . </s>
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that too . </s>
every second of the day our senses are a lot more information than our brain ever oper@@ ated . </s>
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first place for all the information is part of our tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be , the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala . </s>
so the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early war@@ ning system , our job dete@@ ctor . </s>
it ro@@ tat@@ es , and it per@@ c@@ ends all the information on the search for any kind of risk of danger in our surro@@ und@@ ings . </s>
so when we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news . </s>
and the old saying &quot; when it ble@@ eds , the demand goes , &quot; it &apos;s very true . </s>
now , with all of our digital devices that we have seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic . </s>
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always worse to the world . </s>
but maybe that &apos;s not the case . </s>
maybe that &apos;s the reality . </s>
perhaps the tremendous progress that we &apos;ve been acceler@@ ating in the last century has been going through a series of forces , so strong that it will be possible for us to create a world of abund@@ ance in the next three decades . </s>
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , bio@@ diversity , water and energy -- we &apos;ve already got that . </s>
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at looking at problems in a very long way , but finally , they &apos;re going to get over there . </s>
let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve been able to do in the last century , so we can antici@@ pa@@ te the development of this . </s>
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than dou@@ bled to inf@@ lation in inf@@ lation of the world &apos;s population by inf@@ lation has tri@@ pled . </s>
child mortality has reduced by a tent@@ h of a tent@@ h . </s>
and what happens is that the food , the electrical trans@@ port , the communication of communication , has decre@@ ased by a multi@@ ple@@ x@@ ing rate . </s>
steve pin@@ ker showed us that we &apos;re living in a very peac@@ eful time of human history right now . </s>
and according to charles ken@@ ny , the liter@@ acy rate in the last 130 years has increased by 25 percent to 80 percent . </s>
we live in a really extraordinary time . </s>
and a lot of people forget this . </s>
and we keep increasing our expectations all the time . </s>
in fact , we &apos;ve re@@ defined poverty . </s>
remember that a large percentage of americans who live below poverty , access to electricity , water , toilet , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , cell@@ phones , mobile phones , air condi@@ tioning and cars . </s>
the rich@@ est capit@@ alists of the last century , the im@@ per@@ ors of the earth , would have never dreams such lux@@ ury goods . </s>
the basis for a lot of these are technologies , and they grow ex@@ cep@@ tional . </s>
my good friend ray kurz@@ weil has shown us that every tool that is going to be on information technology on the curve of moore &apos;s law , dou@@ bled the price performance of the price of performance every 12 to 24 to 24 months . </s>
that &apos;s why the mobile phone in your pocket costs about a million times less and is a thousand times faster than a super@@ computer from the &apos; 70s . </s>
now look at this curve . </s>
that &apos;s moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years . </s>
notice two things about this curve . </s>
first of all , how smo@@ oth it -- in good times like bad times , war or peace , rec@@ ession , depression and high jun@@ c@@ ture . </s>
this is the result of faster computers building computers building faster computers . </s>
it slo@@ ws down for none of our big problems . </s>
mor@@ e@@ over , despite your log@@ ging , you &apos;re running up@@ ward down on the left side of your log@@ arith@@ mic . </s>

when i think about creating abund@@ ance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of lux@@ ury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of opportunities . </s>
it &apos;s about creating kin@@ dness of kin@@ dness of kin@@ dness . </s>
because scar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ tual , and technology is a resource of liber@@ ating force . </s>
here &apos;s an example . </s>
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ i@@ i@@ . in the middle of the 18@@ th century . </s>
he &apos;s the guy on the left . </s>
he invited the king of si@@ am for dinner . </s>
na@@ po@@ le@@ on soldiers got sil@@ ver bri@@ cks , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself got gol@@ d-@@ be@@ ste@@ ck . </s>
the king of si@@ am but got al@@ umin@@ um be@@ ste@@ ck . </s>
al@@ umin@@ um at that time was the most valuable metal on the planet , valuable than gold and plat@@ in@@ um . </s>
this is why the dome of the washington mon@@ um@@ ent was made out of al@@ umin@@ um . </s>
even though al@@ umin@@ um is 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the mass of mass , it &apos;s not as pure metal . </s>
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and silicon . </s>
but then the technology of the electro@@ ly@@ sis was developed and made al@@ umin@@ um so cheap that we use it with our thro@@ wa@@ way ment@@ ality . </s>
so , let &apos;s put this analog@@ y into the future . </s>
we now think of energy scar@@ city today . </s>
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet filled with 5@@ ,@@ 000-@@ times more energy than we use every year . </s>
16 ter@@ a@@ watts of energy pr@@ on@@ o@@ od every 8@@ 8 minutes on the earth &apos;s surface . </s>
it &apos;s not about scar@@ city , it &apos;s the problem . </s>
and there &apos;s good news . </s>
this year , for the first time , you &apos;ve managed to reduce the cost of solar electricity in india to 50 percent of the growth stream -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es compared to 17 ru@@ pe@@ es . </s>
the cost of solar energy fell in the last year by 50 percent . </s>
last month , this was published with a study that shows that by the end of this decade , there will be six cents in the sun@@ ny areas of solar energy per k@@ w@@ h , compared to 15 cents at the national average . </s>
and if we have an energy over@@ shot , then we &apos;re going to have water abund@@ ance . </s>
let &apos;s talk about water wars . </s>
remember , when carl sa@@ gan was the voy@@ a@@ ger spac@@ es@@ hip in 1990 , when it moved by saturn , it turned back into the direction of the earth ? </s>
he took a famous photograph . how was it meant ? </s>
&quot; a p@@ ale blue dot . &quot; </s>
because we live on a water planet . </s>
we live on a planet that has 70 percent covered in water . </s>
yes , there are 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent of sal@@ t@@ water , two percent are failed , and we &apos;re fighting 0.@@ 5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope there . </s>
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now . </s>
it &apos;s new nanot@@ utes on the way , nan@@ o materials . </s>
and from a conversation this morning with dean ka@@ man , one of the innov@@ ators of the do it , i would like to share with you -- he gave me per@@ mission -- his technologi@@ sts , the sl@@ ing@@ shot , and many of you may have heard already -- it &apos;s the size of a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator at the student home . </s>
it can generate a thousand gall@@ ons of clean drinking water a day from multiple sources -- whether sal@@ t@@ water , pollu@@ ted water , lat@@ r@@ ine -- and all that for less than two cents a gall@@ on . </s>
the cha@@ ir@@ man of coca@@ -@@ cola has just agreed to start a large test project with a hundred units in developing countries . </s>
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confi@@ dent , coca@@ -@@ cola will apply this technology globally in 20@@ 6 countries around the planet . </s>
this is technology assi@@ stance , innovation that we have today . </s>
and we &apos;ve seen this also on mobile phones . </s>
oh my goo@@ dness , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent reduction of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 20@@ 13 . </s>
remember that a mas@@ sa@@ i war@@ ri@@ or with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communications than president re@@ ag@@ an , 25 years ago . </s>
and if you search with your smart@@ phone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago . </s>
they live in a world that has information and communications in abund@@ ance , as no one could ever have predi@@ cted . </s>
and it &apos;s better , the things you &apos;ve spent and i have spent tens of thousands of dollars -- gps , h@@ d video and photograph , libr@@ aries of books and music , technology to medical diagno@@ stics -- now , literally un@@ tan@@ gible and cheaper in your cell phone . </s>
and the best part of that is perhaps what &apos;s expected to us in health care . </s>
last month i had the pleasure of announ@@ cing the quality foundation what we call the &quot; $ 10 &quot; tri@@ cor@@ m tri@@ cor@@ der x prize . </s>
we challenge teams around the world to connect all of these technologies together in a cell phone so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equi@@ pped with ai , you can sc@@ u@@ ttle in or test your blood values . </s>
and to win , the device has to be a better diagno@@ sis than a team of highly quali@@ fied doctors . </s>
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease bur@@ den of disease and 1.@@ 3 percent of the health care staff . </s>
if this device sequen@@ ced a r@@ na , or dna virus , which is not known , it &apos;s going to call the mini@@ stry of health and pre@@ venting a pande@@ mic before its out@@ break . </s>
but now , the biggest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of abund@@ ance . </s>
i call it &quot; the coming billion . &quot; </s>
the white lines are facing the population . </s>
we &apos;ve just entered the 7@@ -@@ billi@@ on-@@ dollar brand . </s>
and just by the way , the largest dis@@ pos@@ al against a population explosion is a better education and diet all over the world . </s>
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online . </s>
by 20@@ 20 , we &apos;re expe@@ cting two to five billion internet users . </s>
three billion new minds that we &apos;ve never heard before are going to join global communication . </s>
what do these people need ? </s>
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to desire ? </s>
and instead of the economic level , i see one of the biggest economic dis@@ hes in history . </s>
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that are going to flow into the global economy . </s>
and they &apos;re going to be heal@@ thi@@ er by using the tri@@ co@@ der heal@@ thi@@ er , and they &apos;re better trained by the k@@ han academy , and so they &apos;re going to have the opportunity to have 3d pr@@ inter@@ s and the internet computing , and so much more productive than ever before . </s>
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community bring us ? </s>
how about a sentence of new , never before hearing hearing voices ? </s>
how about the op@@ pres@@ sed , wherever you are , give a voice to give you a voice , to make your change , for the first time , to make change for the first time ? </s>
what are these three billion people going to bring in ? </s>
how about bi@@ ases that we can &apos;t even predict ? </s>
one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that small teams that are motiv@@ ated by passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that could only create big companies and governments in the past . </s>
i want to close with a story that really exc@@ ites me . </s>
there &apos;s a program that maybe some of you have seen . </s>
it &apos;s a game called fol@@ dit . </s>
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle . </s>
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds to explore how the protein is going to evolve . </s>
according to their behavior , we can predict structure and function . </s>
and this is very important in medical research . </s>
so , this was a problem for super@@ computer . </s>
and this game was played by university profess@@ ors and so on . </s>
and there are hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online now . </s>
and it showed that no@@ wa@@ days , human pattern dete@@ cts better the proteins than the best super@@ computers . </s>
and when these people came and looked at who was the best protein fol@@ der in the world , this was not a mit professor , not a cal@@ tech student , it was someone from england , man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who worked in the office as an assi@@ stant to the office clinic in a re@@ hab clinic , and at night , the best proteins in the world of the world . </s>
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that today we have more power than individuals to make us the great challenges of our planet . </s>
we have access to tools with exponenti@@ al technology . </s>
we have the passion of a book innov@@ ator . </s>
we have the capital of the tech@@ no-@@ philanthrop@@ y . </s>
and we have three billion new heads that we can work with online to master the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s necessary . </s>
we &apos;re expe@@ cting some remarkable decades . </s>
thank you . </s>
i believe that we need to do something about a changing piece of medical culture . </s>
and i think it begins with a medical guy , and i am . </s>
and maybe i &apos;ve been in business for a long time , as that i can allow myself to give up a piece of my own false pre@@ y to make this happen . </s>
but before i get to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball . </s>
hey , why not ? </s>
we are the seas@@ onal close , and we move to the world cup . </s>
we all love baseball , right ? </s>
baseball is full of amazing statistics . </s>
and there are hundreds of them . </s>
&quot; mon@@ ey@@ ball &quot; appears soon , and it turns out to be statistics and to use this great baseball team . </s>
and i &apos;m going to get to a stati@@ stic that i hope most of you have heard before . </s>
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat . </s>
we &apos;re talking about 300 when a bat hits 300 . </s>
so that means that the player is safe to beat three out of 10 feet . </s>
this is called the ball in the out@@ ward field , and he &apos;s coming up , he &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to get the ball on the first base , didn &apos;t have it in time , and the run@@ ner was in safety . </s>
three out of 10@@ th . </s>
do you know how to call a 3@@ 00@@ th in major lea@@ gue baseball ? </s>
well , really good , maybe a american star . </s>
do you know how to call a 4@@ 00@@ ler call ? </s>
that &apos;s someone in the mean@@ time , hit@@ ting four out of 10 . </s>
le@@ gen@@ ess -- as ted willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ ds -- the last major lea@@ gue baseball player who met during a regular season over 400 times . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
let &apos;s go back to my medical medical world where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less comfortable after that i &apos;ve talked to you about . </s>
so imagine that you have a blin@@ d@@ fol@@ der , and you &apos;re going to be trans@@ fer@@ red to an oper@@ ator whose average performance is 400 in terms of blin@@ dness . </s>
some of it doesn &apos;t work , right ? </s>
suppose they &apos;re living in a certain remote area , and they have a belo@@ ved person with clo@@ gged heart co@@ ach@@ es , and her house@@ hold pro@@ ves that to a car@@ di@@ ologist whose average performance of vas@@ cular ima@@ gery is 200 . </s>
but , you know what ? </s>
she &apos;s much better this year . she &apos;s on the rise . </s>
and she &apos;s be@@ ating a 25@@ 7 . </s>
some of it doesn &apos;t work . </s>
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question . </s>
what do you think of the average performance for a car@@ di@@ ologist or a nurse or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c , a birthday shel@@ ter , should be a rescu@@ e assi@@ stant ? </s>
1,000 , very good . </s>
the truth is that no one in all of medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or a teacher should be assi@@ stant . </s>
what we do , though , is that we have each of them , including me in the world to be perfect with the claim . </s>
but never make a mistake , but no one does anything about the details of how to do this . </s>
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school . </s>
i was an inevi@@ table obs@@ essi@@ onal student . </s>
in high school , a student was told that brian gold@@ man would learn for a bloo@@ dy test . </s>
and so did i@@ . </s>
and i learned in my little group of men in the sisters of res@@ iden@@ ce at tor@@ onto general hospital , far from here . </s>
i learned everything as well . </s>
in my anatom@@ y lecture , i learned the orig@@ ins and exc@@ uses of any mus@@ ch , each bran@@ ch of every ar@@ tery , which runs away from a@@ or@@ ta , ob@@ sc@@ ure , normal differ@@ ential diagno@@ stics . </s>
i even knew the differ@@ ential diagno@@ sis in order to classi@@ fy a ren@@ owned tu@@ bu@@ paraly@@ sm . </s>
and all of the time i got started to know more and more . </s>
and i was good , i st@@ ated with c@@ um lau@@ de . </s>
and i left medical school with the impres@@ sion that i knew , if i knew everything , and i knew everything , or as much as possible , as close as possible , that i was im@@ mu@@ te against making mistakes . </s>
and it worked for a while , until i met a woman prin@@ ter . </s>
i resi@@ sted at a teacher hospital here in tor@@ onto as a woman prin@@ ter bringing me into the emergency room department of the hospital . </s>
at this point , i was able to target the car@@ di@@ a@@ c layer in the car@@ di@@ ology service . </s>
and it was my assign@@ ment when the emergency man was looking for kar@@ di@@ ological advice , looking at the emergency patient patients . </s>
giving back to my doctor &apos;s office . </s>
i studied prin@@ ter , and she was in brea@@ th@@ taking . </s>
and when i listen@@ ed to her , she made a ke@@ y no@@ ises . </s>
and when i heard her chest with the ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e , i was able to hear a cra@@ p of sound on both sides , telling me that she suff@@ ered under con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ble heart failure . </s>
this is a state where the heart says , instead of pump@@ ing the entire blood , a part of the blood in the lung is stuck in the lung and filling them up gradu@@ ally , and that &apos;s where the shor@@ ter came . </s>
and that was not a very hard diagno@@ sis . </s>
i hi@@ red her and went to the treatment of the treatment . </s>
i gave her as@@ pi@@ rate . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart . </s>
i gave her medi@@ cin@@ es that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water tab@@ lets , so they &apos;re leaving the liquid . </s>
and over a year and a half to two hours , she started to feel better . </s>
i felt really good . </s>
and then i made my first mistake ; i sent her home . </s>
actually , i made two mistakes . </s>
i sent her home without talking to my super@@ physi@@ cian . </s>
i didn &apos;t take the hearing , and i did what i would have had a call to my super@@ physi@@ cian in order to tell him that he had a chance to have a chance to make his own picture . </s>
and he knew he would have been able to contribute addi@@ tional information to her . </s>
maybe i did it with good reasons . </s>
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid of needs . </s>
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take a responsibility that i was so involved , and so i would be able to worry about my patients without being able to contact him . </s>
my second mistake was worse . </s>
and as i sent them home , i had a quiet voice in me trying to tell me , &quot; gold@@ man , not a good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot; </s>
in really , i was so concerned about self-@@ security that i asked the nurse who was taking care of a woman prin@@ ter , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you &apos;re going home ? &quot; </s>
and the nurse thought about it and said , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go well . &quot; </s>
i remember it as if it was yesterday . </s>
so i put out the in@@ dul@@ gen@@ or , and a hospital and a rescu@@ e assi@@ stant assi@@ stant , and they brought them home . </s>
and i got back to work . </s>
the rest of the day , i had this na@@ gging feeling in my sto@@ mach . </s>
but i kept working . </s>
and at the end of the day , i grab@@ bed my stuff , and i got the hospital and i went to the parking lot to go home with the car when i did something i didn &apos;t do otherwise . </s>
i went home to my way home from the emergency room . </s>
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen prin@@ ter after woman , but another three words to me and these three words fear most of the emergency physi@@ cians i know . </s>
other medical men are also afraid , but the emergency cancer is very special because we only see the patients as whis@@ per@@ ing as well . </s>
the three words said , remember , remember ? </s>
&quot; remember the patient that you sent home to home ? &quot; </s>
the nurse asked the nurse . </s>
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in that particular clay . </s>
so she was back . </s>
she was back and dying . </s>
about an hour after she got home , after i finished her home , she collap@@ sed and the family called 9@@ 11 . the rescu@@ e assi@@ stant took them back to the emergency room station with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous sho@@ cking state . </s>
she rarely breathing , and he was blue . </s>
the emergency room was moving all the str@@ ands . </s>
they gave her blood pressure . </s>
they su@@ mm@@ ed them up to the breathing machine . </s>
i was sho@@ cked and broken up into the inner . </s>
and i lived through this roll@@ er@@ co@@ aster because she came to the intensive care department after the stabili@@ zation , and i hop@@ ed that she was going to re@@ cover . </s>
and after two , three days , i realized she never wa@@ ited again . </s>
she had not suff@@ ered from a human brain damage . </s>
their family gather@@ ed up . </s>
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they gave rise to the deva@@ stat@@ ing . </s>
on the recent day they made her go -- woman prin@@ ter , a woman , a woman and a grandmother . </s>
it &apos;s said that you &apos;re never going to forget the names of those who die . </s>
and that was the first time i &apos;ve learned this myself . </s>
for the next few weeks , i was making myself , and i was driving myself the un@@ healthy shame that existed in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isol@@ ated , not the kind of healthy shame you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about this . </s>
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret to the best friend of the prize , even though that &apos;s going to s@@ ni@@ ff up , and then you get caught up , and then the best friend con@@ fron@@ ts you with it and i have a terrible discussion , if you end up having a bad conversation at the end , and you bl@@ ame that you never make a mistake of that kind of mistake . </s>
if you do res@@ ig@@ do@@ tion and never make the mistake again . </s>
that &apos;s the kind of taught shame shame . </s>
the un@@ healthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one who makes one in the heart of sick . </s>
it &apos;s the one who says it &apos;s not what you did is bad , but you &apos;re bad . </s>
and that &apos;s what i felt . </s>
and it wasn &apos;t because of my doctor &apos;s office , he was very gent@@ le . </s>
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was celebr@@ ating the wo@@ und , and he made sure i wasn &apos;t s@@ laugh@@ tered . </s>
but i kept on asking these questions . </s>
why didn &apos;t i ask the physi@@ cian ? why did i send it home ? </s>
and then my worst moments : how could i make such a dum@@ b mistake ? </s>
why did i go to medicine ? </s>
slowly , but surely it turned out . </s>
i started feeling better . </s>
and then on a wa@@ th@@ less day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun came out , and i could tell myself , maybe i can feel better again . </s>
and i was telling myself that if i double my efforts to perfe@@ ction , and i never re@@ hear@@ sed a mistake that the voice would be conf@@ used . </s>
and she did . </s>
and i kept working . </s>
and then it happened again . </s>
two years later , i had a service in the emergency hospital in a community hospital north of tor@@ onto , and i gu@@ led a 25@@ -year-old man with a gr@@ um@@ py ra@@ ge . </s>
it was a lot less and i got in bal@@ le . </s>
he always showed up here . </s>
i looked into the ra@@ ils , and it was a little pink . </s>
and i gave him a prescri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and i sent him . </s>
and yet , when he was out of the door he showed up on his ra@@ ils . </s>
two days later , i came to my next emergency room service , and my che@@ dy@@ ch@@ ine asked me to talk to her office . </s>
and she said three words : do you remember ? </s>
&quot; do you remember the patient with the um@@ br@@ ell@@ a ? &quot; </s>
it turns out it &apos;s a stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ ene infe@@ ction infe@@ ction . </s>
he had a potentially life-@@ threat@@ ening disease called e@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis . </s>
you can google this , but it &apos;s not an infe@@ ction of the ra@@ p , but the top res@@ pir@@ atory range , and it &apos;s caused by the blo@@ wing of the breath . </s>
and lu@@ ck@@ ily , he didn &apos;t die . </s>
he got in@@ tra@@ ven@@ o@@ se anti@@ bo@@ tica , and he re@@ covered a few days later . </s>
and i went through the same tor@@ ture of shame and self-@@ doubt , feeling liber@@ ated , and i went to work on the work , and i went back to work again and again and again and again and again . </s>
in an emergency class , i &apos;ve seen two times a blin@@ dness of blin@@ dness . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of it , especially when you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that had only 14 patients a night at that time . </s>
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and i didn &apos;t have any men in her treatment either . </s>
in one case , i thought he had ki@@ dney st@@ ones . </s>
i wrote the x-ray of the ki@@ dney , and when it was without evidence , my colleague , in the re@@ ception of the patient , was stuck with a for@@ gery in the lower right sector , called the oper@@ ators . </s>
the other one had strong di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a . </s>
i or@@ dered air@@ i@@ des to re@@ hy@@ dr@@ ate him and asked my colleagues to be able to address him as well . </s>
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he placed a force in the right lower sector , he called the oper@@ ators . </s>
in both cases , oper@@ ators became surgery , and they were doing well . </s>
both cases were na@@ sty to me , ask me . </s>
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake only happened in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues saying , but total non@@ sense . </s>
some of my p@@ ills happened in the last five years . </s>
alone , embarras@@ sing and without support . </s>
so here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t join my mistakes and talk about it , if i can talk about the silent voice that tells me what really happened to me , how can i share it with my colleagues ? </s>
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t get the same be@@ aks ? </s>
if i went into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think about me . </s>
when did you hear the last time someone heard about fail@@ ures about fail@@ ures about fail@@ ures ? </s>
oh yeah , you go to a cock@@ tail party , and you like to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear anyone talking about your mistakes . </s>
if i would go into a room full of colleagues with their immedi@@ ate support and ask them their immedi@@ ate support and tell them what i just told you , i probably wouldn &apos;t be able to achieve the end of the second story , before it really would be un@@ pleas@@ ant , somebody would have a joke , they would change the topic and forget the rest . </s>
and indeed , if i or my colleagues knew that an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c in my hospital would have taken someone &apos;s wrong leg , believe me , i would have trouble looking at him in my eyes . </s>
that &apos;s the system that we live in . </s>
it &apos;s a totally den@@ ial of mistakes . </s>
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes and the ones that don &apos;t make , those who don &apos;t are , the ones that have the sleep lack of sleep and the without limit@@ ation that are with bad results and good results with good results . </s>
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological response like anti@@ bodies that are attac@@ king people &apos;s way . </s>
and there &apos;s the idea that when we give the people who make mistakes out of medicine , we have a safe system . </s>
but there are two problems with this . </s>
in my talk about 20 years of medical sen@@ ti@@ ments and journ@@ alism , i made a personal medical study on medical fail@@ ures and wrong treatments to make all of my first article for the first article i show to the tor@@ onto of the tor@@ onto , &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot; </s>
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able . </s>
we &apos;re working in a system where each day is mistakes , where one of the 10 medi@@ cations either is wrong or wrong in the hospital infe@@ ctions and are going to get more and more numer@@ ous and deva@@ stat@@ ing or dead . </s>
in this state , there are about 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans who are in retro@@ spe@@ ct mistakes . </s>
in the united states , the institute for medicine is pro@@ ving that number at 100,000 . </s>
they &apos;re both strong under@@ taking , because we don &apos;t really see the problem as we should , as we should . </s>
and it &apos;s the cru@@ x . </s>
in a hospital system where medical knowledge has dou@@ bled every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it . </s>
sleep depri@@ vation is ubi@@ quit@@ ous . </s>
we can &apos;t get rid of it . </s>
we have a cognitive mistake , so that we can take a perfect disease of disease for a patient with chest pain . </s>
then i take the same patient with chest pain , swe@@ ar it down and s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed it and give it a little al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic breath , and suddenly the story is per@@ formed with con@@ temp@@ t . </s>
i don &apos;t take the same thing . </s>
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things the same way . </s>
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way . </s>
all of that is in@@ avo@@ i@@ d@@ able . </s>
so if you take the system like i &apos;ve taught it , and all the fau@@ l@@ ty health profession@@ als get out of the system , then no one &apos;s left at the end . </s>
and do you know the gl@@ ue about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ? </s>
in my show , &quot; white co@@ at , black art &quot; i have the hab@@ it of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everyone from the rescu@@ e assi@@ stant to the car@@ di@@ ologist , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; and then i &apos;m going to show you with the micro@@ phone . &quot; </s>
and then their pu@@ p@@ p@@ es , they &apos;re po@@ uring in front of the head , and then they look down and they s@@ wal@@ low , and they start to start telling their stories . </s>
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories . </s>
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same mistakes i calcul@@ ated . &quot; </s>
what they need is an environment that they put in the position of doing this . </s>
what you need is a new medical culture . </s>
and it starts with a physi@@ cian . </s>
the new@@ ly defined physi@@ cian is a human , knows about his humanity , accep@@ ting it &apos;s not proud of making mistakes , but it &apos;s all about learning to learn something from them so that it can pass on . </s>
she shares their experience with others . </s>

and it shows others their mistakes , not to m@@ our@@ n , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way that all of them benefit . </s>
and she works in a medical culture that recogni@@ zes that people filling the system with life , and if that is so , people also make mistakes in time . </s>
so that the system evolved to create ba@@ ku@@ ps that make it easier to make mistakes that make people inevi@@ table , and it allows lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive , suppor@@ tive spaces where anyone who sees health care , can actually actually address things about what potential mistakes are and even re@@ war@@ ding for people who are making mistakes and to be re@@ war@@ ded for the fun@@ er@@ als of that re@@ ception . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s> &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s> &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; </s>
my name is brian gold@@ man . </s>
i &apos;m the re@@ defined physi@@ cian . </s>
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes . </s>
i &apos;m th@@ um@@ bed , but i &apos;m trying to get best to learn from it in order to pass it on . </s>
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding from me , but i can live with that . </s>
so let me close with three of my own words : i remember . </s>
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea . </s>
it &apos;s about transforma@@ tional standards . </s>
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories about using time . </s>
the first story is of charles darwin , one of my heroes . </s>
you know that he was there in 18@@ 35 . </s>
you might think that he &apos;s going to ja@@ il , but that &apos;s not true . </s>
actually , he gather@@ ed fish . </s>
he described one of them as a very , very common . </s>
it was a grou@@ per . </s>
until the &apos; 80s , he was fis@@ hed in a lot of style . </s>
now he &apos;s standing in the red list of dangerous species . </s>
this story has been heard many times by the gala@@ pa@@ gos islands , or in other places , and it &apos;s not very special . </s>
and yet we still come to the gala@@ pa@@ gos . </s>
we still think they &apos;re origin@@ ally . </s>
the bro@@ ws are still describe as being un@@ touched . </s>
so what &apos;s happening here ? </s>
the second story is to be a different concept , the change of the th@@ um@@ b@@ alized , den@@ ial . </s>
because i experienced it when i studied a la@@ go@@ on in western africa in 197@@ 1 . </s>
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa later . </s>
i thought i could integra@@ te myself . </s>
and i got a bad sun@@ burn , and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really come from there . </s>
it was my first sun@@ burn . </s>
as you can see , the la@@ go@@ on of pal@@ ms and some man@@ gro@@ ves were rever@@ sed by a few man@@ gro@@ ves . </s>
there were about 20 inches , a black wall of a black wall , an under@@ way of a bun@@ k of color@@ ed . </s>
the fishing reasons of these tri@@ b@@ al bar@@ k were very re@@ tri@@ ev@@ al , and the fisher@@ men lived very well in ghana . </s>
when i returned to it 27 years later , the fish was shr@@ in@@ king down to half of its size . </s>
it &apos;s grow five inches . </s>
they were gene@@ tically engine@@ ered . </s>
it was still fish . </s>
people were still happy . </s>
and the fish was also lucky enough to be there . </s>
so , it didn &apos;t change anything , but it changed everything . </s>
my third little story told me about my contribu@@ tion to the introdu@@ ction of the dra@@ gl@@ ine fisher@@ y in sou@@ the@@ ast asia . </s>
in the &apos; 70s -- rather , the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- europe was doing a lot of development projects . </s>
fishing pro@@ motion meant countries that have already caught 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing of this rather ugly ship called mu@@ ti@@ ara 4 . </s>
and i went on it , and we went out in all the southern south chinese ocean and particularly in the ja@@ vas@@ e@@ e . </s>
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there . </s>
i know now that it was the cause of the ocean . </s>
90 percent of our fan@@ gs were spon@@ ges , other animals connected to the bottom . </s>
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots on the rub@@ ble of the bu@@ m@@ ble@@ bee , were coral ri@@ ff@@ le-@@ fish . </s>
basically , the bottom of the ocean was on de@@ ck , and then it was then thrown back . </s>
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition is very quick . </s>
within a year , you have an u@@ pli@@ ft through it , and then you start with commercial fishing . </s>
the reason is changing . out of -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft cor@@ als becomes mat@@ ched cra@@ p . </s>
this is a dead tur@@ tle . </s>
they didn &apos;t eat , they thre@@ w them away because they were dead . </s>
we started a living one . </s>
she didn &apos;t get dro@@ w@@ ned . </s>
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat them well . </s>
in fact , this mountain of com@@ mu@@ ters will acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate each time of fish when they go into areas that have never been fis@@ hed . </s>
it &apos;s not going to be docum@@ ented . </s>
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it . </s>
we ad@@ ore our live@@ li@@ hood of the new level , and we don &apos;t remember what was there . </s>
if you gener@@ alize it , this is what happens . </s>
on the y-@@ axis are some good things : bio@@ diversity , number of or@@ ca , the green of their country , the water supply . </s>
over time it changes . it changes , because for the people , their actions are completely natural . </s>
every generation is looking at the pictures that they &apos;re taking at the beginning of their conscious life , as a standard , and it &apos;s going to deri@@ ve all of it . </s>
the difference then is percei@@ ved as a loss . </s>
but they &apos;re not aware of the previous los@@ ses . </s>
it can give you a sequence of changes . </s>
and in the end , they want to only get the je@@ wel@@ -@@ friendly remains . </s>
so that &apos;s where our goal is now . </s>
we want to get things that have disappeared , or things that are not the way they are . </s>
now , you might think that the problem of people who were sure that when they were living in predat@@ ors , they were killing animals that were only aware of some generations what they had done . </s>
because obviously an animal that gave it a lot of time , first rarely , before it dies . </s>
so , you don &apos;t lose the animals quite often . </s>
you lose rare animals and fewer and rare animals . </s>
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a lot of loss . </s>
and over time , we &apos;re focusing on the large animals , and in the ocean , that &apos;s the big fish . </s>
they &apos;re getting more rare because we &apos;re going to catch them . </s>
over time , there &apos;s a little bit of fish left , and we think that &apos;s the value . </s>
the question is why people accept this . </s>
well , because they don &apos;t know that it was different . </s>
of course , a lot of people , scientists , will con@@ firm that it was really different . </s>
you &apos;re going to con@@ firm it , because the evidence you &apos;re trying to do in a previous form are not how you would like to dar@@ n the evidence . </s>
so , for example , the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te is that the report of a cap@@ tain &apos;s report , which has seen large fish in this area , can &apos;t be used , or fishing scientists don &apos;t usually be used because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot; </s>
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past . </s>
that shows the enor@@ m@@ ously big role that can play a marine protected area . </s>
because through marine reser@@ ves , we &apos;re basically re@@ turning the past . </s>
we put the past back again that people can &apos;t understand because the valu@@ ations have changed and very low . </s>
and that allows people to see a marine protected area and benefit from the gli@@ mp@@ se that en@@ ables them to re@@ store their values . </s>
what about the people who aren &apos;t possible , because they have no access -- the people in the mid@@ west for example ? </s>
so here , i think the art and the film maybe filling out the gap and simu@@ lations . </s>
this is the simulation of ch@@ es@@ ape@@ a@@ ke bay . </s>
a long time ago , there were gray whales -- 500 years ago . </s>
and the color@@ ed notes and sha@@ kers may remind you of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot; </s>
if you think of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; when you think about why people were so touched by this -- apart from the po@@ ca@@ honey story , why were they so touched by the ima@@ gery ? </s>
because it calls a little bit of an a@@ wa@@ ken@@ ing that &apos;s lost in some way . </s>
so my recom@@ men@@ dation , the only one i &apos;m going to give is based on camer@@ on so he &apos;s ro@@ tat@@ ing a@@ vat@@ ar ii underwater . </s>
thank you . </s>
in the &apos; 80s , in commun@@ ist east germany , if you had a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had to regi@@ ster that in government . </s>
they also had to run a lea@@ f with an un@@ prece@@ d@@ ented piece of text text . </s>
the reason for this : the government was able to tra@@ ce back where a text came from . </s>
they found an article wrong article , so they could feel the cre@@ ators of this thought . </s>
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , and how much that would restri@@ ct the freedom of speech . </s>
in our own countries , we would never do this . </s>
but if you &apos;re going to buy a new color@@ -@@ laser prin@@ ter in 2011 , you can buy a new laser laser manufac@@ tur@@ er and print a page , then this page of bright yellow spots prin@@ ted on each page , in a pattern that clearly leaves the side of you and your prin@@ ter back to your prin@@ ter . </s>
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening today . </s>
and no one seems to wake up . </s>
and this was an example of how our own governments are using the technology of us , the citizens . </s>
and this is one of the three major sources of today &apos;s existing online problems . </s>
so , let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split the attacks in categ@@ ories . </s>
we have three main groups . </s>
there &apos;s online criminals . </s>
for instance , here &apos;s mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bow from k@@ ie@@ w in the u@@ kra@@ ine . </s>
and the mo@@ tives of online criminals are very easy to understand . </s>
these people deser@@ ve money . </s>
they use online attacks to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money . </s>
there are several well-@@ known cases of online million , multi@@ million@@ ai@@ re , who have ear@@ ned their money through attacks . </s>
this is w@@ la@@ di@@ me t@@ sa@@ st@@ s@@ in from tar@@ tu in est@@ land . </s>
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z . </s>
stephen watt . </s>
b@@ j@@ bedro@@ n s@@ und@@ in . </s>
this is mat@@ the@@ w anderson , t@@ ari@@ q al-@@ da@@ our and so on and so forth . </s>
these people are online online , but they &apos;ve made it illegal for example , using tro@@ j@@ ans , to che@@ at money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we &apos;re doing our online ban@@ king , or key@@ log@@ gers who have collected our credit information information information about the keyboard , while we &apos;re buying over an infected computer online . </s>
u.s. intelligence agency , american intelligence two months ago , the s@@ wis@@ s account of mr. sam ja@@ in here , and in this account , was 14@@ .@@ 9 million u.s. dollars when it was frozen . </s>
mr. ja@@ in himself is on free feet , lo@@ cated lo@@ com@@ o@@ tion is unknown . </s>
and i &apos;m saying it &apos;s more likely that we &apos;re going to become victims of an online negoti@@ ation than a fragi@@ le in the real world . </s>
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will only get worse . </s>
in the future , most cri@@ mes are going to play online online . </s>
the second largest group that we can obser@@ ve today are not motiv@@ ated by money . </s>
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- prote@@ sts about , one opinion , or through their audience . </s>
groups like anony@@ mous are up over the last 12 months , and have become one of the main players on the field of online attacks . </s>
so these are the three major number groups : criminals who do it for money , ha@@ cking , like anony@@ mous , who are strug@@ gling with it , but the last group are nations , governments that lead to attacks . </s>
that &apos;s where we have cases , like the fa@@ in@@ ot@@ ar . </s>
it shows un@@ prece@@ d@@ ented what happens when governments attack their own citizens . </s>
fa@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a complete ma@@ cer@@ -@@ cer@@ ti@@ fication from the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or it was . </s>
in the last fall , it had to sign in@@ so@@ ven@@ cy , because fa@@ in@@ ot@@ ar had been ha@@ cked . </s>
someone was broken , and he had ha@@ cked the system th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly . </s>
and last week in a meeting with du@@ tch government represent@@ a@@ tives , i asked one of the re@@ stra@@ ints of this group , whether he hi@@ red it for possible , that because of the lo@@ ot@@ ar ha@@ cks , people had died . </s>
and his answer was yes . </s>
now , how do people die in a series of such a ha@@ ck ? </s>
fa@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fication place . </s>
they sell cer@@ tifi@@ cate . </s>
what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fied ? </s>
now , a cer@@ tifi@@ cate takes a website with h@@ tt@@ ps , with s@@ ale en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ting service , for example , for example , g@@ mail . </s>
now we all use , or many of us , g@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are particularly pre@@ valent in tot@@ al@@ itarian states like iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign provi@@ ders like g@@ mail , because they know that they can trust more than local incentives , and that they &apos;re en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted about force connections , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ ni@@ ff around their conversation . </s>
but , you know , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign situation , you can do that . </s>
cer@@ ti@@ fication of ha@@ cking and color@@ ed cer@@ ti@@ fied cer@@ ti@@ fication . </s>
and this is exactly what happened in the tra@@ in@@ ot@@ ar tra@@ p . </s>
how does it compare to the arab spring and the things that have happened in egypt for example ? </s>
well , in egypt , the insur@@ gen@@ cy in april 2011 , the head@@ quarters of the egyp@@ ti@@ an intelligence police , and they found a lot of ac@@ res . </s>
in these records , a fol@@ der was called &quot; fin@@ fis@@ her . &quot; </s>
and in that fol@@ der , notes came in germany in germany , which had sold the egyp@@ ti@@ an government a few programs that they were able to do -- very large frame of communication -- all communication of the egyp@@ ti@@ an citizens of the egyp@@ ti@@ an citizens . </s>
they had sold this program for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s to the egyp@@ ti@@ an government . </s>
the head@@ quarters head@@ quarters is right here . </s>
so western governments power tot@@ al@@ itarian governments with tools so that they can take advantage of their own citizens . </s>
but western governments are also helping themselves . </s>
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , we found the head of state , and this was a tro@@ j@@ an that was used by german government workers to pun@@ ch their own citizens . </s>
if you &apos;re suspe@@ cted in a crimin@@ al case , you &apos;re going to tap into your phone . </s>
but today , we &apos;re far beyond that . </s>
they tap their internet connection . </s>
they use tools like the state stra@@ j@@ ar to join their computer computer with a tro@@ j@@ on , allowing them to monitor their entire communication , listen to their online discus@@ sions , to collect their pas@@ s@@ words . </s>
so , if we &apos;re going to keep thinking about this kind of thing , the obvious answer is , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t really matter , because i &apos;m a bra@@ ver citi@@ zen . </s>
i don &apos;t have to worry about it . </s>
i don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot; </s>
and this argument doesn &apos;t make any sense . </s>
priv@@ acy needs to be given . </s>
priv@@ acy is not the debate . </s>
it &apos;s not a decision between priv@@ acy and security . </s>
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control . </s>
and as we are today , in 2011 , our governments like to trust our governments , but every right thing that we &apos;re leaving is all right . </s>
and we trust , do we trust any future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ? </s>
these are the questions that we need to deal with for the next 50 years . </s>
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of concrete block . </s>
the first concrete block were made 18@@ 6@@ 8 and came up with a simple idea : mo@@ du@@ le of cement with soli@@ tude that fit together . </s>
concrete blocks were very quickly the most knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ able building unit in the world . </s>
they were able to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , brid@@ ges , one stone after another . </s>
basically , the concrete block was the building block of our time . </s>
almost a hundred years later , in 194@@ 7 , lego came out of this . </s>
it was called the automatically combine stone rock . </s>
and within a few years , lego has moved in every house@@ hold . </s>
it &apos;s esti@@ mated that over 400 billion st@@ ones have been produced -- or 75 st@@ ones for every person on this planet . </s>
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful brid@@ ges , or beautiful buildings . </s>
lego made it possible for everybody . </s>
lego essentially has the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it a building block for our imagination . </s>
mean@@ while , in the same year at bell labs , the next revolution was announced , the next building block . </s>
the transi@@ stor was a little plastic unit that was created by a world of static , mu@@ tu@@ ally stac@@ ked building blocks into a world where everything was interactive . </s>
like the concrete block , the transi@@ stor allows us to build much bigger , more complex loop , one stone after another . </s>
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transi@@ stor was just experts . </s>
personally , i don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for experts , and so i decided to change that . </s>
so eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to make the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers . </s>
a few years ago , i began to develop suff@@ ers . </s>
so let me show you how they work . </s>
le@@ tt@@ ers are electronic mo@@ du@@ le who have a specific function . </s>
they &apos;re pre@@ fer@@ red to be able to be light and engine and sensor . </s>
and the best thing about this is that they connect with magne@@ ts . </s>
so you can &apos;t put them around wrong . </s>
the st@@ ones are color co@@ ded . </s>
green is ex@@ ternal , blue is electricity , pink is input , and orange is cable . </s>
so all you need to do is connect with one blue and a green one , and they can build very quickly bigger ro@@ les . </s>
they add a blue to a green , and they can make light . </s>
you can put a switch in between , and so they made a little bit of thi@@ ck@@ ening . </s>
take the switch out to be a pul@@ se , which is here , and they made a little thin@@ ker . </s>
you add that bu@@ zz@@ er to an extra effect , and they made a noise machine . </s>
i &apos;m going to stop that . </s>
over the simple game , li@@ tt@@ leb@@ er is actually quite powerful . </s>
instead of having co@@ ding , wired or sol@@ ving , they allow them to code them with simple intuitive gest@@ ures . </s>
so , to acceler@@ ate the blind , or slow down , just turn it on that button , and it makes the impul@@ se faster or slo@@ wer . </s>
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ le-@@ lifetime is that it &apos;s a growing library . </s>
we want to bring every single interaction in this world into a commodi@@ ty stone . </s>
lights , sound , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available . </s>
we have li@@ tt@@ ed children on children and they &apos;re playing with it . </s>
and it was an incredible experience . </s>
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electronics that you have around the day and you don &apos;t know who you &apos;re learning at school ? </s>
like for instance , a night of light works , or why the doors are open to the elev@@ ator , or how an ipod respon@@ ds to touch . </s>
we also brought in li@@ tt@@ ures to design schools . </s>
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with li@@ tt@@ gl@@ it as a material . </s>
here we can see fil@@ ming , paper and water bot@@ tles , like geor@@ die ... </s>
a few weeks ago , we took advantage of li@@ tt@@ ures and gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just car@@ ton , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do something . &quot; </s>
so here &apos;s an example of a project they did , a mo@@ bility oper@@ ator can@@ e can@@ e . </s>
but wait , this is really my favorite project . </s>
it &apos;s a hum@@ mer of pla@@ y-@@ do@@ h , the fear of the dark . </s>
for those non-@@ engineers , it became another material , electronics simply became another material . </s>
and we want to make this stuff available for everyone . </s>
so li@@ ck@@ vi@@ um is the open source of open source . </s>
you can go to the website , down@@ load all the design dem@@ ands and make them yourself . </s>
we want to encourage the world of the cre@@ ators , the invent@@ ors , the contribu@@ tors , because the world we live in , this interactive world , belon@@ gs to us . </s>
so , take a go and start to invent it . </s>
thank you . </s>
